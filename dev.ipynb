The restaurant offers a fancy yet welcoming atmosphere that immediately sets the tone for the night.\\n\\nWe started with the calamari, which was delish - crisp on the outside, tender on the inside, with just the right amount of seasoning. The crab cake was just as amazing, super tasty.\\n\\nThe main dish was undoubtedly the truffle pizza. The combination of a perfectly crisp crust, rich truffle taste in every bite, and carefully selected toppings created a flavor profile that was nothing short of extraordinary.\\n\\nTo complement our meal, we ordered their sweet dessert wine and a bubbly Italian soda.\\n\\nService was amazing - friendly, attentive, and professional. The staff demonstrated an extensive knowledge of the menu and made our anniversary memorable with the candle! I wish I knew the name of our waitress so I could give her a shoutout!!\\n\\nIt’s worth noting that valet parking comes at a price of $20, which might seem steep to some. However, the convenience and overall quality of the dining experience more than justify the additional cost.\\n\\nHighly recommended for date nights, and anyone looking to elevate their dining experience.

Please see the drink in the first pic the barista Angel made. I later asked him to add more milk in it since the drink was barely full. He started to explain how that’s normal since I asked for light ice. I told him I’ve been ordering the same drink everywhere and it was never like this. He insisted I DO NOT UNDERSTAND and told me to stop yelling as I was just trying to explain to him. He remade the drink and I asked to speak to the manager. AND Angel was the manager(Of course lol) He told me if I don’t wanna talk to him regarding that I could call 1800STARBUCKS. I did make a complaint against Angel. I did not want to have to call the hotline if he didn’t give me such bad attitude. The most absorb thing was, my boyfriend went in the SAME STARBUCKS to get A drink 20mins later. He ordered a shaken espresso with light ice as well. And the second pic was the drink he got. Full size drink. SO, I’d like to figure out what really happened',\n",

These pizzas were not only generously portioned but also exceptionally delicious.\\n\\nOur culinary adventure did not stop there. We indulged in a variety of appetizers, including mozzarella sticks, cheese balls, an antipasto salad, spaghetti with meatballs, and a hearty sandwich. Each dish was meticulously prepared, delivering a symphony of flavors that pleased every palate at the table.\\n\\nFor dessert, we savored the delightful cannoli and the sumptuous bread pudding cake. Both desserts were exquisite, providing a perfect ending to an already remarkable meal. Every member of our group was thoroughly satisfied with the experience.\\n\\nHaving dined at this establishment numerous times, we have consistently found it to be a source of culinary delight. It has never failed to meet our expectations. I highly recommend giving this restaurant a try; you will undoubtedly be impressed.',\n",

They have a separate window outside for mobile pick up so that should help limit the people going inside. I just went here to get a plain bagel and I had to wait about 10 minutes for it to be ready.

Everything is baked fresh for the most part, breads are too soft to cut at 7am. Sandwich bread first thing in the morning dissolve in your mouth like a fresh bake croissant. So yes, there desserts do stand apart, and the food with fresh baked anything elevates it. And lastly the service was just awesome - so friendly and patient and kind. If anything, it's a little on the pricey side. But what do you expect during these hard times and asking for freshly baked goods. Parking might be a hassle if you come during rush hour. But highly recommend the area\",\n",

       "         'text': \"I tried this place for lunch since I was looking for something new that also wasn't so heavy like other items around the area are. I chose this place because the of the reviews and also their menu. It seems all over the place since it goes from wraps, to sandwiches, sushi rolls, poke, smoothies, ice blended drinks, and even boba!\\n\\nI ordered the chicken wrap for lunch and chose a side of potato salad. You have three options, which are fries, salad or potato salad. I'll try the other two the next time, maybe with a sandwich. The chicken wrap, I assumed, I was going to receive cold. To my surprise it was warm and that's because it comes with freshly grilled chicken. The chicken was juicy, flavorful, and surrounded by crisp veggies. It also had like a ranch sauce or caesar dressing sauce or similar. But it all worked out well together.\\n\\nThe potato salad was just okay, and it was nothing amazing. It had a decent flavor. Personally, I would not order this item again as it could have been better.\\n\\nThe ice blended coffee was great. Exactly what I had expected from an ice blended beverage. Nothing amazing and I would order it again, but this time in a larger size for me.\\n\\nOverall, this place was much better than I had expected, and it does deserve it's rating as the food was packaged neatly, looked great and tasted great. I will definitely be coming back to this place to try their other items. The place is nice and the prices are more than fair and inexpensive.\",\n",

       "         'text': \"Overall: 4.6/5\\n\\nI came back recently to redeem my birthday drink and received the same amazing service. I really don't know why this location has such bad Yelp reviews. It was a busy morning with a bunch of people inside but the line moved fast and the drink came out in a quick manner as well. Lupe was the cashier who took my order. I made a custom order of a secret menu recipe I found and she was patient as I went through the list. After I ordered, she wished me a happy birthday :)\\n\\nJunior Mints Cold Brew ($8.50): This is a venti cold Brew with 2 pumps of white mocha, 2 pumps of regular mocha, vanilla sweet cream cold foam with a scoop of matcha powder & 2 pumps of peppermint, topped with mocha cookie crumble. This wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be but it was stronger than expected so I could only drink about 1/3 of it. The mocha was concentrated at the bottom so I should have mixed it up more with the foam. Regardless, it was pretty good. If I were to order it again, I would probably cut back on the mocha and replace it with peppermint instead - just a personal preference.\\n\\nCame back another time on a Sunday morning. We had an issue applying our discount on the app so they were nice enough to do it in store for us. They also accidentally made a hot latte instead of iced so they fixed our order & gave us the hot drink for free too. The customer service here is top notch and consistent so this is my go-to location.\\n\\nCustom Iced & Hot Matcha Latte ($6.55): We got a venti matcha latte with 1 pump toffee nut syrup, 2 pumps peppermint syrup, coconut milk, light whip cream, & chestnut praline topping. The iced version is better but both surprisingly had a light peppermint taste. I think the coconut milk flavor was overpowering the 2 syrups so if we went with regular milk or oat milk, the syrup flavors might have come out more.\\n\\nIced Apple Crisp Oatmilk Macchiato ($6.25): I got a standard venti with light ice and it was much better than expected. It literally tasted like fall encapsulated in this drink. I read some reviews where people say the apple was like a sour apple but I didn't think so and the flavor was subtle. The coffee is concentrated on top so you have to mix the drink for it to taste really good.\\n\\nChocolate Pistachio Swirl: I don't think I tried Starbucks' bakery items before so I was pretty excited to try this item. However, the swirl was just okay. The texture was interesting - soft but also a bit powdery (probably not the best way to describe it)? It wasn't sweet from the chocolate and the pistachio didn't really add much either.\\n\\nPistachio Cream Cold Brew: I reduced the vanilla syrup amount by one pump thinking the pistachio cream cold foam would provide enough sweetness, but it did not. The coffee was strong and let's be honest, Starbucks' coffee beans aren't the best tasting. The pistachio cream had a faint pistachio taste compared to other flavored cream cold brews I had.\\n\\nVenti Non-Fat Milk Vanilla Bean Frappe With 3 Pumps Peppermint Syrup, 3 scoops of Matcha Powder, Line Cup With Mocha Drizzle, & Light Whip ($7.85): This was okay the first day but better the second day after the ice melted. The matcha taste became more noticable on the second day. It wasn't very sweet either.\\n\\nVenti Non-Fat Milk Caramel Frappe With 3 Pumps of Mocha Syrup, 2 Pumps Hazelnut Syrup, Line Cup With Caramel Drizzle, and Top off With Mocha Drizzle on Light Whip Cream: This was better than expected but it is sweet, especially after the ice melted. Literally diabetes in a cup so share it and/or split it over a few meals/days!\\n\\nFrozen Mango Dragonfruit Lemonade Refresher ($6.25 venti): I rarely get a refresher at Starbucks so I was excited to try this new drink but it was really disappointing. It barely had any flavor and was mostly ice that I tasted. Surprised that the mango didn't make it sweet or the lemonade.\",\n",

Cold, like from a refrigerator,  cold bacon.  I took it to the counter asking for a new, hot breakfast.   They said sure.  Then the manager came over to ask what breakfast I had ordered.  HUH?  It's on the plate just as the menu described it.   I guess he needed to see the receipt w/o asking for it.  I showed him.  Minutes later I got that same plate back.  The eggs were now browned from warming them up.  The texture was tough.  The taste was different,  not good!  The bacon was warmer, greasier and nearly tasteless.  Sad!  I had high hopes.  From now on no one gets a tip until the meal is delivered in a timely manner and hot!  Shame on you for delivering a meal that sat that long!!!\",\n",

       "         'text': 'Don\\'t knock it til you try it! San Antonio Winery should be on your Summer to do list. You must check out this local winery  before Summer ends.\\n\\nSan Antonio Winery did not disappoint! Wow, not only Summer, year around would be a good time to visit. My visit was a Mother\\'s Day gift from my amazing Kiddos, but we went and thoroughly enjoyed the Soulful Sunday Brunch. Food, excellent! Entertainment was amazing, Live, Fun, and Awesome!\\n\\nStarted with Stella Rosa Honey Peach Brandy started the day and had to purchase a bottle from the lovely gift shop. The staff in every part of this event were so friendly, helpful and we had an amazing time. Private Cellar for this event, but there are other restaurants to try and indoor/outdoor seating available.\\n\\nNow, I know this was a special event, but I walked around and everyone looked happy as we all celebrated something. Birthdays, Doctoral Graduates, Mother\\'s Day,  Bridesmaids getting ready for the Bride\\'s big day, Just Because Day and \"I just love wine day\" (my personal favorite day) 😂\\n\\nThe Brunch was live, we danced, we sang, we ate the perfect brunch, delicious, fluffy waffles, chicken, fruit, grits, just all the things, look at the pictures.\\n\\nNow, I did a wine tasting after all of this. I had my wine tasting hat on, so that\\'s a good sign.\\nSo, I read some comments about this place. People said some things about the wines here. Some negative, so I had to see for myself. My Sommolier, Ellie  with an \"ie\" like me, Kellie, yay! Well, she was so knowledgeable and nice, fun, and shared her knowledge with me about vino🍷learned a lot in 30 minutes. They have great wines and an extensive selection. Stella Rosa is actually a top notch Moscato - it\\'s all in the process. This is a sweet, dessert wine, but not all wines are the same. The Riboli Family has fine wine in addition to the sweets. They also have an extensive tasting area and there is Brandy and Whiskey, I mean a lot of things to choose from - you just have to check it out. They have so many more wines.\\n\\nI learned about notes, tannins, unique varieties of grapes, legs and so much more.  These employees are really cool and they know their stuff!\\n\\nI tasted some fabulous wines. There were mixed reviews about the selection of wines at San Antonio Winery. I saw it for myself and must say, they have some amazing offerings. I don\\'t get paid to say these things. I am speaking from the heart. If I was paid in monthly wine, I would not be mad. 😂\\n\\nMany of their wines are grown in the Paso Robles, CA region. So, I challenge you disbelievers to go check out San Antonio Winery in Los Angeles.\\n\\nWhite wine lovers, try their San Simeon 2023 Sauvignon Blanc. 😋. Red Lovers try San Simeon Cabernet Sauvignon 2020 and if you get to try Riboli Family\\'s Opaque \"Darkness,\" you will be happy that you did. That\\'s a red blend you don\\'t want to miss. Beautiful Wine.🍷 Wow! Check this place out. See for yourself. Taste for yourself.  I will go back to try more of the food next time. For now, Cheers! 🥂',\n",

The restaurant offers a fancy yet welcoming atmosphere that immediately sets the tone for the night.\\n\\nWe started with the calamari, which was delish - crisp on the outside, tender on the inside, with just the right amount of seasoning. The crab cake was just as amazing, super tasty.\\n\\nThe main dish was undoubtedly the truffle pizza. The combination of a perfectly crisp crust, rich truffle taste in every bite, and carefully selected toppings created a flavor profile that was nothing short of extraordinary.\\n\\nTo complement our meal, we ordered their sweet dessert wine and a bubbly Italian soda.\\n\\nService was amazing - friendly, attentive, and professional. The staff demonstrated an extensive knowledge of the menu and made our anniversary memorable with the candle! I wish I knew the name of our waitress so I could give her a shoutout!!\\n\\nIt’s worth noting that valet parking comes at a price of $20, which might seem steep to some. However, the convenience and overall quality of the dining experience more than justify the additional cost.\\n\\nHighly recommended for date nights, and anyone looking to elevate their dining experience. Try to truffle pizza!!',\n",

       "         'text': 'So I’m coming back from Downey (don’t ask), handling some property stuff, and I call up a friend. He just happens to be nearby, and like true sushi soldiers, we decide to meet at Sushi Gen — because of course, that’s what everyone does when they’re within a 10-mile radius of Little Tokyo and feel like standing around hungry for 45 minutes questioning their life decisions.\\n\\nThe wait? Classic. 30–45 minutes, which gives you just enough time to spiral into existential dread while the host gives zero indication you even exist. But finally — we get seated. It was my friend’s first time. He’s a hardcore sushi guy, like the kind who judges you if you say “sushi roll” with too much excitement. We both ordered the hamachi kama (yellowtail collar), sashimi set, and sprinkled in some extra bits of raw sea treasure.\\n\\nHere’s the thing: Sushi Gen is good. The kind of good that makes you nod in polite satisfaction while thinking, “Yeah, okay, I get it.” But in today’s world of sushi arms races and omakase wars, being consistently good is starting to feel like showing up to a Formula 1 race in a Toyota Camry. Reliable, yes. Exciting? Meh.\\n\\nFish quality? Still solid. Experience? Nostalgic and humble. But if you’ve had a tour through LA’s newer spots, it’s hard not to notice Sushi Gen’s staying kind of… still. I give it a respectful 3.8 stars. My friend? Brutal. A hard 2 and said he’s never going back. Might’ve been the wasabi betrayal. Who knows.\\n\\nBut since you made it this far, let me reward you.\\nIf you want a spot that blows Sushi Gen out of the miso soup — go to Fisherman’s Table in Huntington Beach. That place is criminally underrated. Like, “why is this not packed every night” levels of good. You’re welcome. Now forget I told you.',\n",

My group of 5 ate outside at picnic tables with plenty of umbrellas to shade the sun, tall \"hedges\" to block the little bit of street traffic, and there was a nice breeze. There\\'s a WIDE variety of sausages and beverages,  and the service was fast. I had the VEGETARIAN MEXICAN CHIPOTLE with caramelized onions and sweet peppers. Just enough heat in the sausage so the sweet peppers were perfect, and I went with some honey mustard to also balance it. Everyone liked their dishes and drinks.

With a vast and intriguing selection, there's something to tantalize every taste bud. The quality is undeniable, and each bratwurst is cooked to perfection, delivering a burst of flavor with every bite.\\n\\nBut Wurstküche isn't just a one-trick pony. The fries? Oh, the fries! They are, without a doubt, insanely good. Crispy, perfectly seasoned, and utterly addictive, they are a must-order and a worthy companion to any bratwurst selection. Seriously, prepare to be amazed.\\n\\nWhile I'm not a beer drinker, I was pleasantly surprised by the impressive selection of non-alcoholic beverages. It's refreshing to see a restaurant put thought into options for those who prefer something other than beer or soda. This attention to detail shows they care about providing a complete and enjoyable experience for everyone.\\n\\nThe service was friendly and efficient, adding to the overall positive vibe. The combination of great food, a vibrant atmosphere, and excellent service makes Wurstküche a standout dining destination in Los Angeles. Whether you're a bratwurst aficionado or just looking for a fun and tasty meal, Wurstküche delivers on all fronts. Highly recommended!\",\n",

If you're planning to visit, securing a reservation on OpenTable at least a month in advance is highly recommended, especially if you're aiming for a weekend spot—those seats are like gold. There’s valet parking available, but you might also find some public parking nearby if you're lucky.\\n\\nThe place is madse for carb lover’s dream! Everything is made with fresh, high-quality ingredients and prepared simply yet masterfully. Here are a couple of standout dishes you absolutely must try:\\n\\nRoasted Marrow Bone\\nThis dish is a masterpiece. The spinach pasta has a perfectly chewy texture with a hint of charred flavor, and the roasted bone marrow adds a rich, buttery depth without being overwhelming. It’s no surprise this is one of Bestia’s signature appetizers.\\n\\nWagyu Tartare\\nThe wagyu is incredibly fresh and paired with yolk jam, creating a creamy, flavorful combination. Spread it over the grilled bread, and you’ve got a bite of perfection.\\n\\nOh, and don’t forget to try their pizzas! They make everything from scratch, and you can taste the love and effort in every bite.\\nBestia is definitely worth the hype—just be ready to plan ahead for this unforgettable dining experience!\",\n",

Our server suggested we add the Caesar salad and another pasta, so we went for the chestnut & mushroom agnolotti—and both ended up being highlights. The squid ink spaghetti had lobster that was tender and flavorful—a texture different from others I’ve had.\\n\\nThe scallop crudo was delicate and bright—one of those small bites that makes you slow down and actually taste the ingredients. The duck liver was smooth and deep in flavor, and the smoked mozzarella pizza came out hot and melty. The grilled branzino had crisp skin and a juicy inside—simple and cooked perfectly.\\n\\nClassic LA spot that delivers an impressive meal all the way through.

The meat quality went over what I expected, but truthfully, I never go into restaurants with any expectations and I like for the experience to speak for itself. And this one spoke!! Don’t let the years of being around and the dim vibes scare you off. Ever. Those are the best spots and this one is still one of them.\\n\\nI decided to splurge and go with their most expensive menu, which was Gold at $48.99/person. I took advantage of the premium cuts.\\n\\nHighlights: giant beef rib (1pc per 2 ppl), pork jowl, the beef rib finger, and the marinated short rib, and LA Galbi\\n\\nI really love their self service sides bar, because who has time to bug waiters every five minutes for more banchan? Go get it yourself! As much as you want too!\\n\\nBanchan highlights: cilantro kimchi salad, the fish cakes, and the beet dyed radish slices!\\n\\nI loved my server. She was a sweet older woman who was very attentive! Just note that there are always BIG parties of 8-12 people who come at a time, so give the workers grace and patience where it’s needed.',\n",

       "         'text': 'I love a bar with a concept and was obsessed over the library theme. Though not exactly hidden, the walls of books and intimate, cozy seating felt akin to a speakeasy. The contrast of the classic study aesthetic against the neon, almost cyberpunk-esque bar was surprisingly harmonious. Best of all, on a Thursday night at 7pm, this place was barely populated - which was wonderful because I got prime choice of seat next to the bookcase on the sofa and could take as many pictures as I wanted.\\n\\nThe bartender was so nice and helpful in navigating my “reading list” for the night. My first “novel” was the “Adventure of Blackberry Finn,” a blackberry infused vodka with lemon and blackberry smush. On said adventure with Finn, I fell off the raft and was doggy paddling in the vodka. Some cocktails coyly hide their spirits as they lure you into a sense of false security. Library Bar cocktails are not like that. They don’t hide their spirits - they’re leading the pep rally. They are upfront and honest about what they contain. Take a sip and it’s undeniably VODKA. Despite that, I still thought it tasted good. Sweet, fresh, and bang for your buck with how strong it was.\\n\\nThe burger was quite yummy for something served at a bar. Maybe (definitely) I was already quite tipsy at this point, but I liked the burger. My friend thought it was kinda dry, but I didn’t. The fries were also nice and fluffy. I do wish they didn’t run out of the poutine… that sounded good. It probably would’ve helped soak up the alcohol too.\\n\\nTo be honest, I thought the literary drink names were so cute I couldn’t resist ordering a second drink. Of Ice and Mezcal was, as the bartender described it, almost a straight up spirit. Sipping on it was actually quite pleasant - the smoky taste of the Mezcal paired well with the brightness from the grapefruit bitters. But it was definitely too much for my second drink of the night (I really should have listened oops).\\n\\nI would definitely come back! I see myself stopping by after work to bask in the ambiance and enjoy a nice drink - especially on weeknights on their off hours. What should I “read” next hehe…',\n",

This time I also got the Mexican White Bass, which was fresh and flavorful. My fiancé ordered the 12 oz filet mignon with Yukon gold potatoes and was happy. My mother in law had the Chilean seabass with gnocchi: the gnocchi was excellent and the fish had a great sear, though the inside was undercooked. To their credit, the staff handled it quickly and professionally by taking it off the bill. Service was a bit slow, likely due to being slightly understaffed and booked solid, but our waitress was kind and as attentive as she could be. The maple cheesecake hit the spot, and they surprised us with an extra dessert for my fiancé’s birthday, which was a lovely touch. A few hiccups, but still a decent experience and worth the return trip!',\n",

The chicken was crispy and had that perfect kick of spice you’d expect. It’s got that balance of heat without being overwhelming, and the bun held everything together nicely. Definitely hits the spot if you’re in the mood for some good ol’ Southern flavor.\\n\\nNext was the Truffle Cheese Burger. Man, this burger was something else! Juicy patty, perfectly cooked, and the truffle scent really took it up a notch. The cheese was oozy and delicious. If you’re a burger lover, this one’s a must-try for sure!\\n\\nFinally, the Szechuan Beef Noodles. This dish has a ton of flavor! The noodles were cooked just right, and the beef was tender. Plus, it had this great Szechuan sauce that gave it a nice spicy, tangy kick. Totally satisfying if you’re in the mood for something with an Asian twist.\\n\\nOverall, a fantastic meal with friendly service to match. Yard House never disappoints!\",\n",

I had limited time because I and my group of 8 were just grabbing a bite to eat and a drink before going into our concert.  We ordered pizza, cobb salad, and chicken wings. All the FOOD was great.  But what stood out BEST 👌 👍🏽 to me was the AWESOME, PROFFESSIONAL, AND SPEEDY SERVICE I received from the Bartenders KYLE and ALEX.  My drink was   superb, and if it appeared that I was finished with my plate or my  glass was empty, KYLE or ALEX were jolly 😊 on the spot to check in on me.  Service like that received from the servers needs to be recognized and appreciated 👏',\n",

       "         'text': \"Located in a historic town brimming with tales of the past, this wonderful restaurant offers a blend of elegance and entertainment. The outdoor ambiance is enchanting, with a welcoming employee greeting you at the entrance. Upon arrival, a fee of around $30 grants access to the live performance, setting the stage for an evening to remember.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is a sight to behold, with cleanliness and sophistication evident in every corner. The upstairs bar boasts a balcony view that adds a touch of charm to the experience. While the drinks are of good quality, the prices may raise eyebrows, with each beverage costing approximately $20. However, a silver lining is the dinner special which features a 3-course meal starting around $89 per person, offering a decent value for the delectable cuisine on offer.\\n\\nThe true highlight of the evening was the live performance by Tinos Production showcasing exceptional musical talent that captivated the audience. This performance alone made the visit worthwhile, leaving a lasting impression of their artistry.\\n\\nDespite the enchanting experience, the steep prices may deter frequent visits. Additionally, the unexpected gratuity percentage added to the bill, i believe not disclosed in the menu or website, left a slight disappointment. This practice may fall under the new SB478 regulations aiming for transparency in pricing.\\n\\nFor convenience, valet parking services are available in front of the building, albeit likely incurring an additional charge. While this restaurant offers a unique and memorable experience, the overall cost may limit return visits for some patrons. This is my personal opinion and recommend anyone to visit this place  them self's.\",\n",

Arriving a little early, we patiently waited for them to open at exactly 5:00 pm. Since our order was quite substantial, they kindly brought the food to our car in the parking structure. My generous brother left a big tip for both the waitress and the person who delivered the food. The entire family thoroughly enjoyed the meal. I opted for the chirashi, which was a generous portion of fresh sashimi, rice, and a variety of veggies. It paired perfectly with my niece's favorite beer, Allagash Curieux, which I found to be excellent. Later, we also indulged in some sake. The gathering was filled with heartwarming conversations and scrumptious food, making it a truly cherished moment for all of us. Such experiences remind us of the joy of family gatherings and the simple pleasures of life.\",\n",

He started to explain how that’s normal since I asked for light ice. I told him I’ve been ordering the same drink everywhere and it was never like this. He insisted I DO NOT UNDERSTAND and told me to stop yelling as I was just trying to explain to him. He remade the drink and I asked to speak to the manager. AND Angel was the manager(Of course lol) He told me if I don’t wanna talk to him regarding that I could call 1800STARBUCKS. I did make a complaint against Angel. I did not want to have to call the hotline if he didn’t give me such bad attitude. The most absorb thing was, my boyfriend went in the SAME STARBUCKS to get A drink 20mins later. He ordered a shaken espresso with light ice as well. And the second pic was the drink he got. Full size drink. SO, I’d like to figure out what really happened',\n",

       "         'text': \"The Last Bookstore, Los Angeles – Rating: 5/5\\nVisited: August 2024\\n\\nA visit to The Last Bookstore in downtown Los Angeles is like stepping into a living piece of literary art. Originally opened in 2005 by Josh Spencer, it began as a small, passionate venture and quickly grew into a cultural phenomenon. In 2011, it moved to its now-iconic location inside a historic former bank building on Spring Street, where it continues to charm visitors from around the world.\\n\\nThe moment you walk in, you're immersed in a space that blends literature, art, architecture, and imagination. The soaring ceilings, vintage furnishings, and towering bookshelves create a nostalgic yet artistic vibe. The ground floor is filled with new and used books, vinyl records, and cozy reading corners, while a former bank vault now serves as a unique book room.\\n\\nUpstairs, the Labyrinth Above the Last Bookstore adds even more magic. This creative maze features themed book rooms, artist studios, and the famous book tunnel, crafted entirely from stacked books—perfect for photos and exploring. The quirky, whimsical installations make it feel more like a museum than a retail space.\\n\\nEven during our visit in August, the store felt calm and welcoming. The staff were friendly, and there was a quiet buzz among fellow book lovers and curious visitors. Whether you're looking to browse rare finds, soak in creative inspiration, or simply get lost in the charm of it all, The Last Bookstore is an unforgettable experience.\\n\\nIt’s not just a bookstore—it’s a literary adventure, an art gallery, and a piece of LA history all rolled into one. A must-visit for anyone in Los Angeles.\",\n",

I watched the cashier greet each Hispanic customer with a smile and a short conversation but I walked up and nothing. He did thank me at the end of the transaction. Which is the only good thing I can say about that place. I can understand if I was causing problems or stealing but I made a purchase and went on about my day. The funny thing is I'm 45% Hispanic. But because my skin didn't match theirs they were not welcoming. I know what discrimination looks, feels, and sounds like. And being in California with the wide variety of people here from different backgrounds, you would think they'd be kind to all people. Maybe it wasn't about race, maybe it was how I was dressed. Maybe people take one look at me and think I'm racist, but I greeted them with nothing but a smile. And walking into a business I would expect the same. But based off of previous reviews, I don't expect management to do a thing about it. And I don't expect their customer service to get any better.\",\n",

While we didn’t find the book we were looking for, discovering this shop was an even better find. Hennessey + Ingalls is a GEM in the Arts District. They have a beautiful and modern location with easy parking on most days. They categorize everything very well and have wide selections to choose from. I was very happy to see that there were a lot of well-known books and also a lot that were more niche and unheard of for the most part. While wandering around the store, I also saw some selections of cards, notebooks, tote bags and other stationary items for sale. My favorite part was actually the small children’s section. The books there feel handpicked and filled with books about history, niche topics and just some general feel-good books. I think that there’s something for everyone here and well-worth visiting time and time again!\\n\\nNotes\\n- Street Parking\\n- Affordable prices\\n- Easy to find\\n- Niche selections of books',\n",

I was looking for a rare out-of-print book, CONCEPTiCONS, which was written by my son. Not only did they have it in stock, but they also made the entire process seamless. I had them send it as a gift to the chair of the New Haven department where I teach and the director of learning as a special Christmas present.\\n\\nTheir customer service went above and beyond—sending the book with a thoughtful note and ensuring everything was taken care of perfectly. I’ve always appreciated the bookstore’s incredible selection, but this experience really made me a loyal customer.\\n\\nIf you’re looking for unique, hard-to-find art books or just need excellent service, I highly recommend Hennessy & Ingalls. They truly make book shopping an unforgettable experience!\\n\\nIt’s disheartening that, despite my son being an accomplished author, a friend once suggested he stand in front of Home Depot and wait for labor work. It’s amazing how many people fail to understand the harmful impact of condescension and stereotyping. This kind of bias is on full display by Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde, who recently preached to Trump about “crop pickers.” It’s sad to see such ignorance and judgment on public display.',\n",

The Hispanic female manager was very unprofessional and disturbing. I'm a big spender at this store, always spending more than average, and it wouldn't hurt to receive a little customer service when needed. I was returning a carpet I spent $50 on. I had with me all my receipts, so that I wouldn't have a problem  exchanging. Well first she was on the loud speaker, rushing the customers  to stop shopping and come to register. When I get there, she was so discombobulated that she was making me nervous. She kept saying that she couldn't find the rug in the Reciept. I knew that was wrong. I made sure I brought it. I couldn't think straight because she kept annoying me by saying I couldn't return this, and she couldn't help me with that. I said as much money as I spend here,  I deserve a little time to find the receipt. She ended up letting another cashier finish my transaction. I ended up paying for other stuff that was supposed to be exchanged, and taking the rug back home. Once I sat down and checked, boom there was the receipt the whole time. Not hidden, not lost. And if she just looked at the damn thing she wouldn't have wasted time annoying me by repeating that they were closing. I wasted time, gas, mileage, money and a good mood because of her unprofessional conduct. If she had just allowed me to be calm, and showed excellent customer service, then this review wouldn't be so long and detailed with  negatives. She shouldn't be allowed to close the store because it's interfering with customer satisfaction and creating this unfavorable review. Train her on the value of customer service. Thank you.\",\n",

I usually get coffee along with some food, and everything I’ve tried has been really good. I’ve had a few of their pizzas, each one was delicious. Crusty and flavorful. I also really love the chicken wrap, probably it is the best I’ve tried so far. Last time I tried sandwich and it was also great. The portion sizes here are generous, and the prices are very reasonable, especially for that area. The food always comes out pretty quickly and tastes fresh. The coffee and tea are also good.\\n\\nThe interior is really nice. There are plenty of tables and different seating options. My favorite spot is the cozy sofas in the corner, it’s the perfect place to relax or to work. Overall, it’s a great place to meet up with friends, have a casual meal, or even get some work done. They also have outdoor tables, which are perfect for enjoying food on a nice day.\\n\\nThe staff is amazing, always friendly, respectful, and welcoming.\\n\\nI haven’t been here in the evening yet, when the cafe transforms into a wine bar, but I’m really looking forward to checking that out. Honestly, I don’t have anything bad to say about this place. It’s a great spot, and I’ll definitely keep coming back.',\n",

       "         'text': 'It has been many years since I have come to this location in Venice, and I was so pleased. My last visit was in 2019, before the pandemic. It was delicious then. it is divine now. Last night, I met up with a friend for her birthday event, and was not disappointed. I have always loved the food and service, and was so pleasantly surprised when I walked in the door. We had made a reservation for 10 people, and they seated us in the back, we had plenty of room! In the six years since my last visit, the location has transformed dramatically, the inside looks beautiful and refreshed, and the food options have expanded. I love vegan food. The group of girls I was with are all carnivores, but we all adore café gratitude, and our girlfriend wanted to spend her birthday here. Everything is delicious. I ordered an “i am mystical” adaptogenic mayan hot chocolate with almond milk, and for my main, a bowl with black beans, vegan cheese, potato, kale, tomatoes, onions, carrots, zucchini, allllll the veggies. The table had ordered several starters, including the loaded nachos, fried cauliflower, and something that I think was meant to resemble calamari, but may have actually been jackfruit. Delicious, delicious, delicious, all of it and the portions were so massive, I took half of my entrée home. Another person ordered a pizza, and it looked freaking delicious. As a South Asian American woman, vegan food is not unusual for me. Café gratitude takes such great care with their flavors, spices, ingredients, and I love that the menu has sections with specific details about allergies. Service was amazing as well, our server was a lovely young man (aussie or kiwi with long blonde hair?) who was kind enough to take our group photo at the end of the evening. The angelic server brought over some strawberry ice cream with a candle for our birthday girl. Do yourself a favor and come to this restaurant, I promise you won’t be disappointed. I love it so much, and I wish I didn’t live so far away. I don’t bother with street parking in that area, it’s impossible to find. I like the underground lot. They do validate and take some $ off the parking, if you park in the underground lot.',\n",

We ordered cappuccinos, eggs over easy for the wife and French Toast for me. French Toast is my go-to dish for breakfast at a new restaurant.\\nThe coffees came quickly. They were quite large, which surprised us. However, they were very good with a good amount of foam, but not too much. This gave us high hopes for the food.\\nThe food arrived soon, delivered straight from the kitchen. The wife's eggs were to her liking, the bacon was crisp, the toast was dry and there was a small bowl of chopped fruit, too. The wife was delighted with everything.\\nI was also delighted with the French Toast.  Without fear of contradiction, I can say it was the best French Toast I have ever had. The toast was fluffy and stayed that way for the whole meal. The bread was brioche, I found out later.\\nThe portions were large. I couldn't finish mine, which is really saying something. The wife joined the 'clean plate' club and that is also saying something.\\nAll in all, we were very pleased with our choice for breakfast.\\nThe inside decor is straight from IKEA, but clean and comfortable. The staff was friendly and efficient. The food was worth going back for.\\n\\nBottom line: worth a visit. A bit expensive but that just might be the dinosaur in me. It was $40 for the whole shebang and we got to watch the doings on Wilshire Blvd.\\n\\nUpdate (13 Feb 2024): Went here again today. Only self-serve now (I guess they have to pay their people more so they eliminated that to save money. ) Order at the counter, about the same price and food quantity. There was a different taste to the French Toast today, not bad, just not as good as before. Wife was pleased with hers.\\n\\nStill worth a shot.\\n\\nParking at the back.\",\n",

This afternoon my friend and I stopped by to pick up two iced matcha drinks and a selection of grab‑and‑go items, since the BOGO promotion was advertised as applying to all grab‑and‑go products.\\nOutside, Sebastian the barista was exceptional: courteous, professional, and attentive. He explained the offer clearly and reminded us to keep our receipt to redeem our BOGO offer. Once inside, I selected 14 grab‑and‑go items (seven paid, seven to be free), plus my two drinks. At checkout, however, the cashier applied the discount only to the cheapest paired items—so instead of a 50% BOGO, I received closer to a 20% savings. I was disappointed, but still made the purchase. When my girlfriend returned to pay for  her items, she was brusquely told that the BOGO applied only once per receipt—information we’d never been given beforehand.\\nWe asked to speak with Gil, the store manager, who was dismissive and refused to correct the mistake. Only after we flagged the issue again to Sebastian who offered to intervene—speaking with Gil on our behalf and apologizing when the answer remained “no.” As an olive branch for our trouble (and because we were freezing outside), he kindly offered us a hot ginger‑turmeric drink.\\nKreation is at its best when team members like Sebastian are serving—you can feel his genuine commitment to customer care. Today’s experience, by contrast, showed that promotions must be transparently communicated and that managers should be better trained to resolve issues with the same courtesy and professionalism as Sebastian displayed. I hope Kreation invests in more “Sebastians” and ensures every team member upholds the brand’s promise of clear, friendly service.',\n",

I loved it more than any other cake, but every summer since, this store has not had this cake available. It’s available for pickup in the Bay Area and Vegas, but why not here in LA!? Bring this cake back and I will be sure to order many each summer and increase my rating to 5 stars!',\n",

Eggs were light and fluffy, with a cream cheese addition I had not experienced in a scramble. They were incredible. Flavor profile is one thing to master, but keeping an egg scramble light, fluffy and creamy in the same bite is an art. The side of potatoes were the perfect flavor and consistency. A healthy portion that didn't allow me to finish the serving. Plenty for two people.  Cocktails were a 4 of 5, and my chicken chorizo was slightly dry, but the overall experience was so enjoyable, it merits a 5 across the board. Delightful! Can't wait to return.\",\n",

The updated policy that prioritizes employee wellness and support has truly set a welcoming tone for the entire experience. It’s evident that happy employees lead to better service.\\n\\nI also appreciated the commitment to sustainability that's evident throughout the store. The new reusable cup program is back, and encourages customers to bring their own cups.\\n\\nI love that Starbucks is making an effort to reduce waste. THE NEW LIDS 😳\\n\\nPlus, I noticed the expanded menu options that cater to different dietary needs, from plant-based milks to gluten-free snacks. This inclusivity makes it easy for everyone to find something they love.\\n\\nAlternative milk is no longer extra! Same price for all milks. Fire.\\n\\nThe ambiance of the store remains inviting, making it the perfect place to enjoy a cup of coffee while catching up on some work or simply relaxing with a book. I ordered my favorite blonde latte, and it was made perfectly —proof of their dedication to quality.\\n\\nOverall, I’m having excellent experiences at Starbucks recently. It's heartwarming to see a brand that truly cares about its customers and employees alike. Starbucks is just tried and true, not just for the excellent coffee but also to support a company that's making positive strides in the community!\",\n",

       "         'text': 'When the Doors Close: Starbucks, Survival, and Losing a Lifeline\\n\\nFor most people, Starbucks changing its policy to restrict non-paying customers or making you pay for water might seem like a minor inconvenience. Just another corporate decision to tighten things up. But for someone like me, this isn’t minor—it’s a gut punch. Starbucks wasn’t just a coffee shop to me. For years, they’ve been my go-to for something as simple and vital as water. A resource that, when you’re living on the margins, can mean the difference between making it through the day or not.\\n\\nThis isn’t just about losing free water; it’s about losing one of the few places I could turn to without judgment. Starbucks was more than a business—it was a refuge, a creative hub, and a lifeline. It’s where I’ve created countless videos. It’s where I’ve gone to write (like this review) recharge, and find a moment of peace in a chaotic world. For someone like me, who has no permanent place to be, Starbucks has always been one of the few constants.\\n\\nNow? That’s gone. And sure, some might say, “Just buy something.” But it’s not that simple. When every dollar counts, when you’re stretching nothing into something, even a $3 coffee feels like a luxury. And beyond the cost, it’s about what this change represents. It’s a hard shift away from the inclusivity that made Starbucks a beacon for so many people in need.\\n\\nI remember back in 2018 when Starbucks opened its doors to everyone after that high-profile incident in Philadelphia. Two Black men were arrested for sitting in a Starbucks without buying anything. At the time, I thought, This is going to blow up in their face. I imagined bathrooms turning into shooting galleries and stores overrun by chaos. But to my surprise, Starbucks handled it with real class. They leaned into the challenge and showed that a business could be both accessible and functional. For someone like me, who relied on that accessibility, it was a game-changer.\\n\\nStarbucks became a place I could always count on. Whether I needed water, a restroom, or just a moment to catch my breath, they were there. They didn’t just talk about inclusivity—they lived it. So this policy reversal isn’t just disappointing—it feels like a betrayal of the very principles that made me rethink my entire view of the company.\\n\\nBefore I came to California, I used to bash Starbucks all the time. I mocked their “woke” policies and liberal ideals, rolled my eyes at their inclusivity, and dismissed them as another corporate giant trying to buy goodwill. But when I got here and started relying on their open-door policies, I saw the other side. I realized how vital those policies were—not just for me, but for so many others.\\n\\nNow I have to ask myself, where do I go from here? The library? Let’s be honest—libraries these days feel more like holding pens for homeless people than spaces for creativity and peace. They’re monitored and controlled, not welcoming. Starbucks was different. They gave you space to exist without demanding anything in return. That kind of freedom, that kind of respect—it’s hard to find, and it’s even harder to lose.\\n\\nFor someone like me, this is more than just a policy change. It’s the loss of stability in an unstable world. It’s the loss of a little bit of hope, a little bit of humanity in a world that already feels like it’s closing its doors tighter every day. Starbucks was a place I could count on, a place that said, “You belong here.” Now, that door feels a little less open. And that, for me, is a much bigger loss than just water or a seat. It’s losing one of the last places that felt like it saw me.',\n",

After flying into LAX with my beau, we stayed here, and it was the perfect choice. This gorgeous boutique hotel has such a vibe – from the friendly staff to the stunning decor. The bathroom tiles were a work of art, the beds were super comfortable with big pillows, and the room temperature was just right.\\n\\nWe had a ball! It's conveniently close to Beverly Hills and Rodeo Drive, making it easy to explore the best shopping spots. The breakfast and oat milk coffee were delicious, and they even catered to my dairy-free dietary requirements, which I really appreciated.\\n\\nA must-visit hotel with the best views opposite the beach and sea.

Clean rooms, friendly staff, prices, however, rather high.

       "         'text': 'We stayed in January 2025 in two Deluxe Ocean view rooms.  Rooms were clean and adequately furnished. Rooms had usable mini fridges.  We had a room on each side of the building so views were either overlooking the driveway and facing the Santa Monica pier in the Venice direction (south east) or overlooking the pool area and towards the Palisades Park and beach (north west) (both with ocean views just opposite directions). Other reviews did complain about the nightclub music. Our room facing north (opposite side from the nightclub the music was not noticeable, the south facing room yes the music was noticeable however if the balcony door was closed it was ok.  The older building seems like it would be far enough away not to hear it. Really great gym with good equipment and free weights.  Really nice pool and the temperature was just perfect (weather was a bit gloomy most the days we were there and we still went in the pool comfortably every day). Nice hot tub in pool area also. The majestic tree out front of the lobby and the entrance gives a really nice vibe.  The Dogtown coffee was a good regular start to the day.  The location is nice just a little up and away from crowded pier area but still walking distance to 3rd Street Promenade shopping and plenty of food options around. Also easy walk to the Pier. There is also a hotel car which can take you to local places at no charge.  Valet parking was efficient also. Great friendly staff, really enjoyed this hotel and will return when next in LA.',\n",

The ocean view from my room was absolutely breathtaking—waking up to that horizon each morning felt like a dream. The room itself was stylish, comfortable, and spotless, with great attention to detail throughout.\\n\\nOne of the highlights was the Penthouse Restaurant at the top of the hotel. The panoramic views of the ocean and city are unbeatable, and the food and cocktails were just as impressive. It’s the perfect spot for a sunset dinner or a relaxing brunch above the city.\\n\\nThe Huntley has that rare mix of laid-back California charm and upscale sophistication. From the design to the service, everything felt thoughtful and first-class. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a memorable stay in Santa Monica.',\n",

The place is super clean and really cute and comfortable.  The outside exterior is very nice as well.\\n\\nThe service is super good. They are fast and know their menu. They have great fries. They also sell beer and some imported.\\n\\nBut what you want is a sausage sandwich. They are served hot and just great. We love their simple BRATWURST, which is fine cuts of pork, coriander with some nutmeg. Their BOCKWURST is yummy veal and pork. Also try some of their hard to find elsewhere ones, like RATTLESNAKE & RABBIT with JALAPEÑO PEPPERS. It is very buttery and a tad spicy.  The PHEASANT with HERBS DE PROVENCE is just great. Everything they have is wonderful.\\n\\nYou can have it delivered or do take away.\\n\\nWhat we really love is you can buy uncooked sausages there. We do that a lot. You can make your own sandwiches, add them to your pizza or put them with pasta. They are just the best. Whenever we go we stock up. They freeze well.\\n\\nYou will love this place.',\n",

The bread they serve is good, feels like homemade and goes very well with butter.\\n\\nThe pasta had a nice flavor, and the sauce had a slightly sweet taste to it, which was interesting. The shrimp were okay, pretty standard, nothing more to say. Overall, the dish tasted good, but it didn’t feel particularly special or memorable to me. I feel that the prices are a bit high for amount of food. I would say the food was good but I didn’t really enjoy it.\\n\\nThe restaurant was busy when we arrived.

We telephoned the restaurant even though it had already closed for the night, and the team immediately invited us back to search.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, the staff were cleaning up but had already started to look for the ring and helped us look through the restrooms and, kitchen. At least three or four employees actively helped, including providing gloves and helping us go through the trash to ensure it was lost in a restroom trash can. It was clear that everyone was genuinely concerned and willing to do whatever they could. Although the ring was not found, their professionalism, empathy, and willingness to stay late and actively help without question have left a lasting impression.\\n\\nI mustn’t forget the meal itself had been excellent: well‑prepared dishes, attentive yet unobtrusive service, and a well‑chosen wine list.\\n\\nTaken together with the staff’s extraordinary support, the experience showed Il\\u202fForno Trattoria at its best.\\n\\nIt is the epitome of excellent service.

The lemon salmon was also okay.  Quality of salmon was great but the spiciness overpowered the citrus.  The last roll we got that was all the fish layered together with cucumber was surprisingly great.  The texture worked and enjoyed it!  For the entree, we got the short ribs which was amazing (was like Korean galbi jjim but really really reduced sauce) and the miso cod was amazing.  The quality of the cod was so fresh and loved the picked asparagus.\\nFinally, the Tokyo Sour cocktail was simply elegant.\\n\\nLoved the service.

       "         'text': 'My husband and I walked in here thinking it was a cute little cafe spot. And it is not. Let’s start off with service. The wildest thing is being Latino and being served by all Latinos who give you a dirty look cause you’re not white. But maybe that’s cause all the white people who go dine there don’t care to get ripped off. We got seated and was only given a drinks menu. (Mind you I am 7 months pregnant!) why would I need alcohol?? Server came about 10 min later asked us for drinks I had to ask for non Alcoholic he gave me juice options. My pineapple juice was served in a white cup small portion and it was $16 are you kidding me not even a whole pineapple is worth $16. Then after our drinks nobody gave us a menu or checked in on us. Noticed right away white looking people were served better. How sad. By the time I got my menu it was very unorganized they have them in this heavy hard plastic and then a sheet of paper like a cheap brochure for brunch and Lunch. I had to ask the server what the food items came with because it has no explanation only what they came with or what they were. So all in all for two meals one juice one cocktail it was like $180..and I think they included tip so ridiculous please don’t come here even thought it’s  aesthetically pleasing to look at the food is not good. Also why is it Mexican food mixed with Italian and random breakfast?? Nothing g sounded good tbh. I got the burger and my husband got the chicken plate. Oh and how nice of them to be so kind to give us one muffin each as an appetizer lol',\n",

       "         'text': 'For a higher-rate restaurant, not many of the menu options caught my eye.\\n\\nI decided to try the calamari ($26), and it was very underwhelming—super squishy, lacking any crunch, and overall bland. The accompanying sauces didn’t do much to help either.\\n\\nWith pastas reaching the $50 range, I opted for the 8oz filet mignon ($68), expecting a well-executed steak. Unfortunately, it was a major letdown. The filet was drowned in their house-made steak sauce, which made it taste more like a pot roast than a proper steak. Worst of all, I ordered it medium rare, but it came out past my requested finish.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is beautiful, but the street noise from cars driving by and honking really takes away from the ambiance, making it hard to enjoy the atmosphere.\\n\\nThe staff was great—attentive and polite—but even they seemed aware of my disappointment and weren’t able to do much about it.\\n\\nI always like to give places a second chance, but Ivy is not somewhere I plan to return to. Given my experience, I’d hope the chain would reach out to make things right, to at least better the experience of future guests.',\n",

They saved me, because I had ordered a gift from Amazon but it came broken....this on the same week that Amazon did not deliver two other packages.  Thank goodness for JennyBec’s, an amazing real life store!\\n\\nThe store was organized, the selection was really great - gifts for kids of all ages and interests, and the prices were reasonable and get this -  they wrapped the gifts for FREE. You just don’t get service and assistance like that on Amazon. Also free parking in the back of the store.\\n\\nThe other reviewers who said the prices were expensive...I do not think so, based on the price comparison I did on piggy banks, coloring books, geodes, and markers. The prices may have been $2 or $3 higher than other places, but not unreasonable (in my opinion) considering that you get real people helping you, free gift wrapping, free parking, a good selection....what else can I say?  :-)',\n",

She had vitamins and teas for us and literally served us each drink to ensure we all could feel like a goddess this weekend. Her yoga classes and meditations were refreshing and energizing for the body and soul. We all left the retreat gaining new insights. It felt like a wonderful sisterhood of women who were there to support each other during this beautiful retreat weekend. Alanna is a warm and beautiful soul, deeply caring for the wellbeing of her clients. I think that every woman should get a chance to have have this beautiful experience at least once in her life. Thank you, Alanna for pouring your heart and soul into helping others learning to live a healthy lifestyle 💕\",\n",

I didn’t know what to expect with only juice and soup and herbs for the three days, but I never felt hungry or had any cravings. As a total beginner with yoga, I have to admit, it kicked my buttocks. However, my jeans were a little looser when I went home. As for meditation, I have some difficulty with that… SQUIRREL! It’s a little difficult for me to stay focused. Now that I’m back home, I started to check social media, saw a nasty comment from someone, was going to send a nasty response, when I decided to just let it go, which is what Alanna taught us to do. I am grateful for the weekend. Thank you very much, Alanna, it was the detox retreat that I truly needed.',\n",

I panicked. I lost my patience.  Suze the studio owner ran outside to help me - by then I was hyperventilating and panicking- I was late to pick up my kids. She helped me breathe in the parking lot to cool down! She asked me to come and take classes and relax.  Never took her offer - why? Because I was running - running-For 30 years.  I didn’t know that had I accepted her offer - may be I wouldn’t have been beaten by life and its viciousness.  I joined 2 weeks ago! I’m blown away - these classes are life.   You are surrounded by positive kind people-incredible instructors. In just two weeks - I can see the transformation in my body and mind.  Life can be stupidly but it’s simple to figure out. All you have to do in breathe and slow down. Now: I wanted to extend an apology to Suze - for not being my best self at that moment 13 years ago! I hope she reads this review.  And I thank you for creating goodness to help us Suze.  Thank you 🌷Dina',\n",

In Santa Monica, Barnes & Noble has become our preferred destination, especially given the scarce number of bookstores in downtown nowadays. The Barnes & Noble location on 3rd Street Promenade is a delightful addition and stands out as a phenomenal success.\\n\\nThough it is somewhat smaller than their typical stores, this quality actually enhances its charm, making it feel more authentic and welcoming.\\n\\nThe layout, with two floors, thoughtfully caters to diverse interests. The lower level is wonderfully suited for younger readers, featuring a selection of toys and an impressive, well-curated collection of Mangas that we particularly enjoy. Despite its more compact size, the store does not compromise on variety, offering an extensive range of books across different genres.\\n\\nWhat truly sets this location apart, however, is the staff. They are incredibly helpful and friendly, contributing to a sense of customer intimacy that is sometimes lost in larger spaces. It's clear that the cozy atmosphere of this smaller space fosters a closer connection between the staff and patrons.\\n\\nIn summary, our family's experiences at the Barnes & Noble on 3rd Street Promenade have been nothing short of wonderful. It's a gem of a bookstore that we'll continue to visit and support.\",\n",

They  went out of their way to help us find my daughter’s phone after she accidentally left it in the bathroom. Talk about great service!\\n\\nThe museum itself is really clean, modern, and beautifully decorated.

All the dishes are named as affirmations. Your server will ask what you’re grateful for and you will place your order by stating the affirmation your dish is named. Upon serving you, your server will affirm that you are “giving” or “glowing” or “loving”, etc.\\n\\nThey have collaborations from time to time, so be aware that what you order today may not be on the menu next month. One staple dish I absolutely recommend for the table: I am Caring — loaded nachos (add the guacamole, it’s worth it).\\n\\nThe dishes are very flavorful and yummy. After our meal, my omnivore friends and I talked about eating more like this. Don’t be surprised if you feel the same way too after eating a healthy hearty vegan Cafe Gratitude dish.\\n\\nNotes:\\n- Recommend making reservations for dinner on the weekend.\\n- Ambience is super casual and unpretentious.\\n- Service is excellent—kind, personable, attentive.\\n- Parking is easy since they actually have parking below the restaurant and on the side AND it’s free! You can, at the very least, be grateful for that. 😉',\n",

He went above and beyond to help with my order and made sure my meal met my dietary needs. I was especially impressed with how understanding and accommodating he was when I realized my dish had powdered sugar in it—something I can’t have due to health restrictions. Alfredo didn’t hesitate to resolve the situation and even removed the item from my check without any fuss. It really showed how much the restaurant cares about wellness and supporting all their guests.\\n\\nWhile the server I initially spoke with seemed unsure and mentioned that the sugar was listed on the menu (which it wasn’t), I would simply suggest that the staff get a little more familiar with the ingredients in each dish.\\n\\nOverall, what could’ve been a disappointing experience was completely turned around thanks to Alfredo’s kindness and professionalism. I left with a full belly and a grateful heart—just as the name suggests. I’ll definitely be back!',\n",

Both the fish and chicken were too breaded for my liking. The sauce they served with the chicken was very good though. The cornbread pairing with the turkey chili was good.\\nI didn’t get to try their cocktails since I had to go to work after, but the choices were numerous. I would’ve like to try their desserts too, but we were already full.\\nNot much seating inside if you exclude the bar section. The outdoor seating was very pleasant.

First floor’s temperature is a lot cooler and there’s a nice breeze (good for the summer heat). The second floor is more stuffy, but it is quieter and more individualized so you can focus on work. There’s plenty of NICE seating outside too, where you can work or chitchat.\\n\\nThe menu is very diverse ranging from drinks to whole meals. I always get their bottomless iced tea which is around $7, and you can refill it however many times you please. I’ve had their earl grey scone (couldn’t taste much earl grey but you see the tea leaves in there) and matcha white chocolate scone with jam and butter - solid 3.5/5. I’d get it again because it’s simple and easy to eat. I also tried the breakfast quesadilla which was pretty good 4/5! For lunch later, I tried the chicken pesto sandwich was really delicious 4.8/5. Their side of salad is pretty yummy too. Their menu is very captivating, and I definitely want to come back to try more.\\n\\nParking is street meter parking. Service is very friendly.

The line is always out the door continuously. We finally got a decent coffee after being in Universal City for the theme park. We ordered so much food. $120 worth of food for the both of us.\\n\\nAmazon Rainforest Smoothie- mostly tastes like acai and bananas, like a smoothie I make at home.\\n\\nPistachio latte- the perfect sweetness and the perfect amount of pistachio flavor. SOOO deliciously made.\\n\\nLatte- delicious\\n\\nItalian cappuccino- less foam with more milk. Delicious.\\n\\nYes we each had 2 drinks. LOL!\\n\\nThey ran out of pistachio chocolate croissant and the Nutella girella bun. So I ordered a chocolate croissant- the most disappointing item today. It wasn’t buttery, airy, fluffy or chewy. It was stale and blah. $5 gone.\\n\\nKing French Toast- not worth it. It was a big brick of bread with lots of strawberries and blueberries around it. The French toast is a wet style type of French toast. It came with a little syrup cup. It was a simple French toast, nothing special that I could get anywhere. It just had a nice presentation.\\n\\nBreakfast sausage side 2pcs- they were sooooooo juicy and flavorful. The breakfast sausages are worth it.\\n\\nPoached salmon- so delicious. The multi grain bread tasted better than it looked. Eggs were poached perfectly and the salmon was nice and salty.\\n\\nSalmon plate with onion bagel- the onion bagel was so much better than my chocolate croissant! The salmon and capers were perfect together. Cream cheese was whipped and fluffy. Roman tomatoes were very sweet. I loved eating half of my dish wrapped in the Romain lettuce and the other half in my onion bagel. So refreshing.\\n\\nI would definitely come back again and try more items.\\n\\nParking sucks!

The iced coffee never came, even after I asked two employees about it missing. I finally went back to the coffee counter to locate it myself. I went with two friends and all of our food and drinks came out at different times which seems inefficient. We did grab a small table by the street which was great people watching!

The food is hearty and delicious, the atmosphere is welcoming, and the bar scene is always buzzing.\\n\\nTheir rotisserie chicken is a must-try—perfectly seasoned, juicy, and satisfying. The chicken pot pie is another standout, packed with rich, comforting flavor and topped with a flaky, golden crust. Add in classic sides like garlic mashed potatoes or grilled veggies, and you’ve got the ultimate feel-good meal.\\n\\nBirds also shines when it comes to drinks and social energy. Their hopping bar and lively happy hour make it a great place to unwind after work or catch up with friends. The staff is friendly and fast, and the whole space has a casual charm that makes you feel like a regular—even on your first visit.\\n\\nIf you're looking for a laid-back, consistently great neighborhood hangout with solid American fare and a fun bar scene, Birds is a Hollywood gem you don’t want to miss.\",\n",

Well for me I don’t get what the big hype is.\\n\\nThe place itself is cool. Didn’t particularly like a sign that they have on the wall that states something about loose women. Sure the sign comes off as funny, but might make some women upset. Especially now a days.\\n\\nOur server was good, but seemed swamped as he had all the tables and a Buser to assist. He still remained attentive which was amazing.\\n\\nWe ordered fried pickles. They were some of the best I’ve ever had and their sauce was on point.\\n\\nI also had the French onion soup. Not a big fan. Too much bread in the soup. You can also taste allot of butter from them toasting the baguette before they put in the soup. The soup itself didn’t exhibit much flavors. The mozzarella wasn’t very good either. Not sure what brand they use, but it’s definitely not of high quality. Also, this is one of the most expensive French onion soups I’ve had. For that being said…definitely not worth the price.\\n\\nMy colleague and I both had burgers. Yes, I know we go to a chicken place to get beef. The buns were dry. Meat was cooked perfectly, but had no salt or any flavor.\\n\\nThe Mac and cheese that came with my burger was exactly that. No effort, no wow factor, and no seasonings. Just pasta, cheese, and a sprinkle of bread crumbs on top. Box Mac & cheese is way better than this…lol.\\n\\nI tasted my colleges baked beans. They were good with allot of smoky flavor.\\n\\nAll and all I don’t really know what the buzz is about either this place, because if you truly had people who had a good pallet this place probably wouldn’t be open as long as it has been. Not a fan and would only recommend the fried pickles with maybe a beer.',\n",

I've been going to this restaurant every time I'm in Los Angeles for the past 10 years. It's one of the only places in the country that make me crave Italian. Pictured are the Truffle Pizza and the Mushroom Alfredo with Shrimp. The pizza is exquisite - light, airy, buttery, full of flavor, and the crust has that perfect crispness. The Mushroom Alfredo was filling without being heavy. All the flavors were perfectly balanced, and the addition of the shrimp was the perfect addition. The shrimp was also perfectly cooked, sweet and succulent.  This place is not to be missed, especially if you're a fan of Italian cuisine.\",\n",

       "         'text': 'Rating the food here is hard for someone who\\'s been a patron for 20 years because the rating slides based on the cost. Sure, the eggs toast and potatoes are tasty. Meatless, for $15? +$4 for bacon?I mean how many stars can you give that?\\n\\nIn April 2025 there was a blanket increase in all prices at KRC. As a person who studied economics, you should consider the narrative of the price increase against the reality of those increases: an instant, 25% increase across the board in menu items is not how you mitigate business costs, as the narrative suggests. It would be a much smaller percentage if the narrative were true.\\n\\nTake the coffee for example. It used to be $4. I think you can conservatively say KRC will sell at least 20 coffees an hour. So prior to the increase last month, they grossed $4x20 = $80/hr x 8 hrs= $640 day x 6 = $3840 x 4 = $15360 Gross a month in coffee.\\n\\nNow, to \"mitigate business costs\" KRC coffee went from $4 to $5...a 25% increase to one item. Using the same math as above:\\n$5 x 20 = $100/hr x 8hts = $800 day x 6 = $4800 x 4 = $19,200 Gross a month in coffee.\\n\\nThat\\'s an extra $4000 gross per month, just for coffees.\\n\\nTo put this in perspective, if you work a corporate job and are up for a promotion, you will get 3%, 5%, unheard of maybe 7%. In no way are you getting an instantaneous 25% increase to your salary.\\n\\nIf our gas went up 25% from the $4.69 it is, your gas would be $5.86. Could you conceive of waking up tomorrow and seeing gas for $5.86? There would be riots. When it goes up $0.10, it makes the news.\\n\\nIf Kings Road particularly cared about mitigating the cost of business but also being fair to its customers, that cost of a coffee would have went from $4 to $4.30. A blanket raise of 25% to the cost of a coffee, while selling hundreds of them a day, is simply taking advantage.\\n\\nThis review is meaningless, every seat outside will be taken every day with people happy to spend their money there. Good for them. But remember, these increases are not to mitigate business costs. It is a gratuitous raise in prices. Two eggs toast, bacon and potatoes for $19?.. more power to you.',\n",

They’ve spent time trademarking the hotel on Google and trying to add tech features. I got almost a dozen emails and messages from them during my two night stay which became obnoxious. The rooms have some nice furnishings, they’ve tried. I felt fairly safe. The bathroom was the worst. Poorly in disrepair, wallpaper tearing, rust everywhere, lights had problems turning on. Everything in the room felt damp. I didn’t shower for my whole stay.  The gym was cramped and gross. Bottled water cost $3 in the vending machine. Elevator I’m pretty sure was not to code.\\nThis is the type of hotel where you wish you would’ve paid $150 more to stay in a better place. I know I did.\\nI will say: the night manager 4/5 into 4/6 was amazing. He let me in quickly when I got in late and helped me feel safe in the morning getting my car from the street.

       "         'text': 'I’ve been visiting Chateau for many years now. I’ve stayed at the hotel and dined here many times. I had the worst experience today. I made a reservation online for lunch today for a party of three. First, the hostess that came over to great is after we were seated was completely arrogant and uppity. After asking her to sit us in the garden rather then in the area she sat us, she seemed annoyed and upset. She informed us she had to get person from the hotel maître D’ which was fine.  The Maître D’ came over to our table and asked us if there was a problem in a very authoritative tone. I explained that I would like to be seated in the garden as that’s where I usually would sit when I visited the restaurant in the past. She then told me no because for the reason that that area was only for hotel guests which was untrue because I had sat in that area many times before even if I didn’t stay at the hotel. The hostess then moved us over to a low seated sofa that was near the front that was way too low to eat a meal at so I suggested sitting at a table across that area. So she sat us there with of course a long face and a very rude disposition. After ordering our drinks from our waiter Alex, the area where we sat was very hot due to not having shade or an umbrella over the little area. Alex cam by and I merely asked if he wouldn’t mind moving the umbrella that was adjacent to me over us so we could have some shade as we really liked this table but just needed shade. He then told me we will move you guys over to that area after I ask the maitre D’ — I never asked Alex to move us. I asked if he could move a umbrella over to where we were. So, here we go, moving for the third time. At this point, I felt like all of the hotel staff was annoyed at us because after that Alex was horrible. His service was minimal and he didn’t acknowledge any small talk. He barely came over to ask if we needed water or anything. The hostess had whispered something in his ear as my daughter noticed and it was awful after that! Not only was I disgusted at this service for Chateau. I felt invisible and unseen and it didn’t feel good. I’ve been a customer for many years here but frankly after today I will never go back! Very disappointing. I’m from the Santa Barbara area and live here in LA and in Scottsdale.\\n\\n— anonymously saddened by this',\n",

       "         'text': 'I sent this to the chateau a couple weeks ago and never heard back, so here you go…\\n\\nGood morning Casey. I spent the weekend at the chateau with family in a two bedroom suite and wanted to give you some feedback on our experience.\\n\\nFirst, we love the hotel and have stayed here many times. It’s always been a special place and we were looking forward to another great stay. Unfortunately the service on this trip was a big disappointment.\\n\\nWe checked in at the desk at 2:15 Friday and were told the room wasn’t ready. The desk person said “the room had just been vacated” (never a good thing to say when check out is usually 11:00 or 12:00) and that it would be ready soon, around 3:00. We went to the pool and called the desk at 3:00 and they said closer to 4:00 and they would bring us the key at the pool area. I never heard back so I called at 4:00 and was informed that the room was ready (would have been nice to know) and would we like to have the key delivered to the pool area.  Ok fine. They also agreed to get our bags up to our room. We finally got the key and saw our bags on a cart on the ground level unattended so we just took them ourselves (anyone could have taken them). I was left with the impression that staff was just not communicating with one another or with us through this episode.\\n\\nOn Thursday last week I received a very nice email welcoming us and asking if we needed help with dinner reservations or anything else. I asked for a 6:30 dinner reservation on Saturday and three in-room pedicures at 9:00 am on Saturday. The response was quick and I was told that everything was taken care of. Wonderful! I followed up right away with an email asking to change the pedicures to 10:00 am but never heard back. When I called after we checked in to ask about the time change for the pedicure the staff person said “oh yes, I changed the time but didn’t get back to you.” Um, ok, I guess.\\n\\nOn Friday evening as we were leaving for dinner I called the front desk to ask for more coffee pods and some milk for coffee. When we got back from dinner we had the coffee pods and milk but our door had been left unlocked.\\n\\nOn Saturday morning at 10:00 am I called the front desk to ask if the nail technicians were on their way up and was told they should be here any minute. At 10:30 they still had not shown up and nobody had called so I went down to the front desk to cancel the pedicures. The people at the desk seemed confused.\\n\\nOn Saturday afternoon I went to the restaurant hostess and asked if we could change our dinner reservation from 6:30 to 7:30 only to find that we did not have a reservation. They said that they would find a way to fit us in at 7:15.\\n\\nAny one or two issues would not have been a problem but it seemed to be one thing after another and it added up to an overall negative experience. Not what one would expect for a $2,000 per night hotel room. I wanted to send this directly rather than posting it to a review website hoping you would appreciate knowing.\\n\\nThanks.',\n",

To get the best customer service you have to \"be somebody\" because they tried to not let us in to begin with saying they were closed when they were clearly open.

Upon serving you, your server will affirm that you are “giving” or “glowing” or “loving”, etc.\\n\\nThey have collaborations from time to time, so be aware that what you order today may not be on the menu next month.

Alfredo didn’t hesitate to resolve the situation and even removed the item from my check without any fuss. It really showed how much the restaurant cares about wellness and supporting all their guests.\\n\\nWhile the server I initially spoke with seemed unsure and mentioned that the sugar was listed on the menu (which it wasn’t), I would simply suggest that the staff get a little more familiar with the ingredients in each dish.\\n\\nOverall, what could’ve been a disappointing experience was completely turned around thanks to Alfredo’s kindness and professionalism.

When I couldn’t decide, our incredibly friendly waiter, Crawly, stepped in with great recommendations, and I couldn’t have been happier!\\n\\nWe started with the cauliflower appetizer, which was absolutely DELICIOUS. For my main dish, I chose the “I Am Loyal” (Taquitos), and they completely exceeded my expectations. My friend had the “I Am Kansha” (a Japanese-inspired dish), and it was superb!\\n\\nFor dessert, I treated myself to the white chocolate pistachio truffle, and we shared the house-made ice cream—both were heavenly.\\n\\nThe staff were so welcoming and helpful, the restaurant was clean (including the bathrooms), and the food was incredible.\\n\\nI highly recommend trying out this place!',\n",

Chicken tasted like something was extremely burnt in the oil and transferred. Not very much flavor either. Then I requested ranch for my daughter's chicken strips and they didn't mention the extra charge of $2.50 then proceeded to serve me 2 full side dishes of salad dressing ranch. Our meal came to $80.

Our server Martin (pictured below) never came to take our food order after getting our drinks, leaving us waiting for an unreasonably long time before we had to flag the manager down to take our order. Throughout the meal, there was no effort to check on us, refill drinks, or ensure we had what we needed. To make matters worse, the food took an excessive amount of time to arrive, with no updates or apologies for the delay. It felt like we had been completely forgotten, and by the end of the meal, I was beyond frustrated.\\nWhen I finally asked for the bill, I requested to speak with the manager, hoping to share my concerns so the service could improve in the future. Instead of listening and acknowledging the issue, the manager immediately dismissed my experience, insisting that the server was great and implying that my complaint wasn't valid. I wasn't looking for a free meal-I simply wanted my feedback to be taken seriously so that others wouldn't have to deal with the same poor service. Instead, I left feeling unheard and disappointed, with no confidence that anything would change. I WILL NOT BE BACK\",\n",

(Bought at the sunset location)\\nI don’t know what did not allow them to meet the criteria of the pizza, but if you can’t deliver the same quality of service to a product you sell each time you sell it. I believe it’s better to put it out of stock and try harder until you get it right.\\nBesides, I always call and get my order over the phone, and I understand that it might be late nor very busy, but it’s a common thing. As I called in after trying to order online and the website not allowing me to do so. A worker said he wouldn’t mind doing my order since it was a pizza that needs 20 minutes to be done, and I would be driving down to pick it up, but he said he would double check with the manager. Then someone superior if not the manager come to the phone and just told me “sorry, you have to presently be here to order” I hung up, drove 12 mins down, got there… ordered my pizza and was asked to wait “20 minutes” outside.\\nThen got my pizza “44 minutes later, as I walked up and asked twice for the pizza to a worker, and it was just seating there in the counter at the little heating compartment…\\nSo I didn’t mind the wait. I was too hungry to complain and they were busy. I understood things happen.\\nI drive back home and I FINALLY get to eat my “EXTRA CHEESE Frango com CATUPIRY pizza”. I’ll leave the picture down bellow of the pizza I got a few days ago to the left and the pizza I got today. ( I don’t believe I even need to explain which is which, you will know which one was todays unsuccessful order).\\nMade me regret driving down to buy it and I’m so ashamed I called my friend to come share it with me. (Since it’s usually a decent size for any regular pizza)\\nThis time it came SMALL, burnt and with no extra cheese, very little catupiry and mozzarella cheese was thrown all of it as if they ran out of catupiry and didn’t communicate about it. Can’t even think about the little chicken scoop the spread thru the whole pizza\\nReally sad and might not be ordering there again. Rather choose anything else but to go on that location. Hope you all fina solution to a better deliverance to your costumers orders from now on.\\nThe only great thing was the host at the door.\\n(June 1 at 2:30am)!!',\n",

       "         'text': '“Hungry for More… Literally”\\n\\nTwo stars for Catalina Jazz Club, and that’s being generous. Let me set the stage: We bought VIP tickets for a drag show—because nothing pairs better with a night out than a fabulous queen and (what we hoped would be) fabulous food. We arrived at 7:50 PM, 40 minutes early, ready for a night of trash talk, bad wigs, cheap costumes, inappropriate songs, and gastronomy.  Instead, we got a masterclass in how not to run a dining establishment.\\n\\nIt took 20 minutes for anyone to acknowledge we existed. By the time drinks and appetizers arrived (another 20 minutes later), the show had started. Fine, we thought. Let’s sip and snack while the queen slayed.  But then… nothing. No entrées. No waiter. Nada. We sat through the entire show, hungry, confused, and wondering if our main courses had been kidnapped.\\n\\nAfter the curtain fell, our waiter reappeared—like a magician, but not the good kind—and handed us a bill that included the entrées we never got. When we flagged him down to explain the situation, he looked genuinely baffled, like I’d asked him to explain quantum physics. He muttered an apology, vanished again, and eventually returned with a revised bill. Then he disappeared for good.\\n\\nAt this point, the only thing well-done was my patience. We ended up paying at the front just to escape. The only redeeming factor? The performer. The queen was amazing. The service? A royal disaster.\\n\\nWould I come back? Only if Sherry Vine and Jackie Beat were headlining together, and even then, I’d bring snacks in my purse. Come for the show, but eat beforehand—or risk starring in your own tragic comedy of errors.',\n",

The most number of side dishes, with unlimited refills. No place in South Korea, Seoul or USA that I know of that gives you this many side dishes.\\n3. They cook for you. I'm too lazy to cook at home... why do I want to cook in a restaurant where I'm paying to go to... to eat?\\n4. Bragging rights because of #2. Novel experience. Impressive picture.\\n5. Delicious, freshly made, and best quality.\\n6. Variety of the side dishes. It's like a tasting menu for Korean side dishes.\\n7. The best services always! I've been here probably over 50 times within the last 5 years.\\n8. Great group place. If there's at least 2 of you, then this is it. The more the merrier sort of place. Because you can just spend time tasting the 25 something side dishes and just talk about them and an hour pass by.\\n9. The wait staff are like models. I don't know where they get them but like... The men are like kpop stars and the females... Yeah... I'm drooling... Because of the side dishes of course!\\n10. I can't count. Jk. The overall experience is amazing. The best Korean BBQ place overall. I've been to both locations.\",\n",

The restaurant's atmosphere is inviting and cozy, and we were fortunate to have made a reservation, allowing us to secure a table on a bustling Saturday evening.\\n\\nThe antipasti, including the Squash Blossom Fritti, showcased a delightful balance of flavors with the ricotta, Parmigiano, and lemon wrapped inside the squash blossoms, and the deep-frying added a pleasant texture. The selection of salads, particularly the Tricolore drizzled with Parmigiano, served as excellent starters before we moved on to the renowned pizzas.\\n\\nThe Napoletana pizza was a standout dish, featuring a delightful combination of flavors from the tomato, mozzarella di bufala, olives, anchovies, chiles, and fried capers, all perfectly balanced on a beautifully cooked pizza dough. The outstanding crust added to the experience, while the anchovies provided an enjoyable saltiness. The Meat Lover’s pizza was also very satisfying, loaded with bacon, pepperoni, fennel sausage, guanciale, tomato, and mozzarella.\\n\\nOverall, we had a wonderful time enjoying delicious food with friends, and both the service and ambiance were commendable.\",\n",

From the first crackle of molten cheese to that perfect char on the crust, every bite feels earned. But the real star? Herbie, the maestro behind the flame.\\n\\nWatching Herbie work is like seeing a choreographed ballet: he slides each pie into the hearth, spins it with practiced flair, and pulls it out in seconds—golden crust, puffed edge, flawless. He moves with such precision and speed you almost expect applause when the pie slides out. He’s not just cooking; he’s performing, and every customer is front‑row.\\n\\nThe pizza menu reads like a love letter to wood‑fired authenticity: classic Margherita, pepperoni with that sweet‑smoky bite, seasonal veggie pies where roasted peppers and blistered onions shine. And don’t sleep on the standout quattro formaggi—oozing ricotta, fontina, taleggio, and mozzarella in gooey harmony.\\n\\nAnd, more than pizza: Start with their house‑made arancini: crispy on the outside, molten risotto and gooey cheese on the inside. The fresh burrata salad, drizzled with olive oil and basil, bridges that line between light and indulgent. And for dessert? The peach Stager (yes, that’s its name!)—a warm peach galette with creamy gelato melting into sticky-sweet fruit. It’s the perfect cooldown after an inferno of flavor.\\n\\nEvery aspect of Pizzeria Motor screams craft and passion—from the dough proofed until it sings, to the fire that kisses each crust just right. Herbie’s pizzas? They’re not just food; they’re a show, and if you care about wood‑fired perfection in LA, this is your stage.\\n\\nFinal verdict: Pizzeria Motor is the must‑go‑to place in LA for pizza—the complete showstopper. Herbie charts the course, the menu delivers across the board, and the vibe is effortless but electric. Five stars—and then some.',\n",

       "         'text': 'It smells great but it’s cramped at the busy hours (usually at nights because they have author meetups during the evenings). It’s a small bookstore, and btw, they sell the books at full price (check Amazon’s full price for the book, that’s the price they’re sold). It’s good for convenience’s sake, but if you would rather wait for your book, I’d go with Amazon. Sometimes the books are bent, so not all the books are totally brand new (as most bookstores suffer from). Additionally, it’s cool that they have the Annex. The Artist’s Annex (located on the right hand side of the bookstore) has magazines from Thrasher to film magazines to naughty magazines and in between. There is where all the comics, magazines, art and music related books and the historic comics are.\\nGoing back to main bookstore, book selection is sparse regarding each category. There is stuff on the war in Palestine, philosophy from the pre-Socratics to the contemporaries, classics, contemporary fiction and non-fiction, etc.\\nCons: Sparse selection and a cramped space during busy hours (usually in the evenings).\\nPros: Wide selection of books, you can order online and pick up, great location with superb restaurants nearby, author meet ups happen at night (check their schedule).',\n",

After that I would never ask a book seller for help again. But that’s just me tho. I love this bookstore, I love that bookstores can still exist in the age of Bezos. They had many good titles suggested on the end caps. Eventually I just chose a book at random based on the fact that a lot was in stock (which signaled it was popular) I liked the title and cover, and the back said something like “sometimes the perfect book finds you.” Which vibed like a fortune cookie and totally worked. The book is called Outline and I can’t remember the author. I’m on the first chapter and so far my little gamble has paid off. In summation, support your local bookstore, preferably this one.',\n",

I ended up buying a Nuna Revv rotating car seat and it has saved my back - love it so much! It can be scary to order expensive items online before checking them out in person, and you can’t just roll up to Target to see Nuna, Joolz, or other premium brands.

I had my newborn baby with me and the whole process took 1 hour!! I knew exactly what I needed and that was no line but they were taking their time and were super unfriendly. Manager was extremely rude when I asked just one question about the color. When they finally had everything ready I told them I’m Fit4mom member and they give 15% off for members. The manager said “really?” Are you?” - with discuss on her face and then asked for the proof which I was happy to provide. I can’t describe how mean manager was.

It was frustrating but I’m not sure if it was truly anyone’s fault - at least not the store itself. We came here after calling to ask if the book we were buying as a birthday gift was in stock (it was!!) but as we walked into the store the employee there said he was about to close for a break but the store would reopen in 20 minutes. We were a bit annoyed because we just wanted to take the book and pay (it would have taken 2 minutes) but we get it - they need to take their breaks! We figured that’s a short enough time that we could wait and enjoy the free outdoor concert going on outside. 20 minutes go by (rather slow to be honest - concert was not that great lol) and the store is not open. Okay. That can happen. But the door sign says they will be back in 30. Okay so he got it wrong. That’s fine. 30 minutes go by and still not open. 45 minutes go by and someone finally shows up. A different employee I might add!! So they did a shift change with a 45 minute break (the second employee was late I assume?) and the second employee was carrying a bunch of books. The purchase took less than 2 minutes and we were pretty annoyed that we were waiting over 45 minutes for that. It’s a small store so the employee must have known it wouldn’t take long. But—all in all we kind of want to blame ourselves because we should have explained that to the employee and not been so polite. But the late employee and weird shift change set up should be fixed. Had we not urgently needed the book we would have ordered online and that’s what we will do in the future! So not too bad but not great either. Th',\n",

Likewise to many bookstores, the philosophy section isn't too huge and is  mixed in with spirituality books. I think this is a great bookstore if you're an individual who's more politically left leaning. They have quite a bit of books that are from the standpoint of social justice.\\nThey are also a gift store of the sorts selling pins, cards, and the like.\\nOn top of it, the different stores surrounding the bookstore are great. There's a pizza shop next door as well as a coffee shop across the street that has alot of outlets and quite a bit of seating. So once you're done picking up a book, you can head on over caffeinate up and breeze through the book You picked out.\",\n",

Welcoming atmosphere and staff that goes above and beyond to fulfill one’s book quest.\\n\\nI stopped by the store approximately 1-2 weeks before the September 3, 2023 release date of “Time Without Keys” Ida Vitale distributed by New Directions. A pleasurable exchange and book conversation with Quinn and Emma who placed the order and upon my walk today stopped in to pleasantly find out it was there in a punctual manner. Their team work and friendly demeanor exceptional. I call him The Mighty Quinn as a reference to the song and the fact we both prefer the Manfred Mann cover! Good to have some lighthearted humor in the mix.\\n\\nIf you look at the photos closely there is one with the bag. Pay attention to the store stamp. Quinn stamps each bag one by one!!! This is how much heart and love goes into the endeavor. Support this store and share with others who love books and writer events.',\n",

There were also a few nice hardcover copies of less commons books which were priced competitively.

       "         'text': 'I love the outdoor seating. It is located on a corner where it looks very aesthetically pleasing. There’s a very small dining area inside as well. The line is always out the door continuously. We finally got a decent coffee after being in Universal City for the theme park. We ordered so much food. $120 worth of food for the both of us.\\n\\nAmazon Rainforest Smoothie- mostly tastes like acai and bananas, like a smoothie I make at home.\\n\\nPistachio latte- the perfect sweetness and the perfect amount of pistachio flavor. SOOO deliciously made.\\n\\nLatte- delicious\\n\\nItalian cappuccino- less foam with more milk. Delicious.\\n\\nYes we each had 2 drinks. LOL!\\n\\nThey ran out of pistachio chocolate croissant and the Nutella girella bun. So I ordered a chocolate croissant- the most disappointing item today. It wasn’t buttery, airy, fluffy or chewy. It was stale and blah. $5 gone.\\n\\nKing French Toast- not worth it. It was a big brick of bread with lots of strawberries and blueberries around it. The French toast is a wet style type of French toast. It came with a little syrup cup. It was a simple French toast, nothing special that I could get anywhere. It just had a nice presentation.\\n\\nBreakfast sausage side 2pcs- they were sooooooo juicy and flavorful. The breakfast sausages are worth it.\\n\\nPoached salmon- so delicious. The multi grain bread tasted better than it looked. Eggs were poached perfectly and the salmon was nice and salty.\\n\\nSalmon plate with onion bagel- the onion bagel was so much better than my chocolate croissant! The salmon and capers were perfect together. Cream cheese was whipped and fluffy. Roman tomatoes were very sweet. I loved eating half of my dish wrapped in the Romain lettuce and the other half in my onion bagel. So refreshing.\\n\\nI would definitely come back again and try more items.\\n\\nParking sucks! Be patient and read signs.',\n",

I got the salmon plate, which came with a seeded bagel (options were plain, onion, or seeded) and an iced coffee. The salmon plate was delicious!! The iced coffee never came, even after I asked two employees about it missing. I finally went back to the coffee counter to locate it myself. I went with two friends and all of our food and drinks came out at different times which seems inefficient. We did grab a small table by the street which was great people watching!

       "         'text': 'Joan’s on Third has the best Chinese chicken salad! I’ve ordered their short rib sandwich too- which is also delicious. I’ve never been to one in person, but this weekend I ventured my way here. I was surprised to see they had breakfast options! Although we didn’t order it, their corned beef hash looked amazing. They also have so many goodies. It was like Disneyland inside. They had ice cream, a dessert area, snacks, candies, and food options in the cases like quiches, lasagna, meatballs…\\n\\nThey have open seating. It was crowded on a Saturday but the service was great and the food came out quick and hot. Definitely need to check this place out if you’re in the area and want a delicious bite to eat!',\n",

       "         'text': 'So unique, so amazing!\\n\\nI came to Joan’s for lunch, after hearing great things about their new burgers.\\n\\nAfter looking through their sit down menu, we tried out their lunch selection, which was delicious. My chili dog was much larger than expected, and was an amazing blend of rich brioche bread, tender sausage, and savory chili. As for the burger, the beef was great quality! Their pickles are made in-house, as well as their house sauce, which was evident in their fresh, unique taste. However, if there is one thing you order, try the delicious onion strings. They are so crispy, perfectly battered, and sweetly onion flavored. Definitely a slept on treat.\\n\\nI was highly impressed by the sheer variety of items available at this location. From grab-and-go deli items, to wines, to desserts and sweets, to restaurant-style hot meals, there is something for everyone!\\n\\nJoan, the owner, is incredibly friendly. She talked to us about the menu, and even recommended some of her favorites. It’s truly refreshing to see a business owner so invested in their product. In fact, the entire staff was outstandingly kind, especially the kitchen crew, which deserves all the recognition!\\n\\nHighly recommend! 😼',\n",

       "         'text': 'Rating the food here is hard for someone who\\'s been a patron for 20 years because the rating slides based on the cost. Sure, the eggs toast and potatoes are tasty. Meatless, for $15? +$4 for bacon?I mean how many stars can you give that?\\n\\nIn April 2025 there was a blanket increase in all prices at KRC. As a person who studied economics, you should consider the narrative of the price increase against the reality of those increases: an instant, 25% increase across the board in menu items is not how you mitigate business costs, as the narrative suggests. It would be a much smaller percentage if the narrative were true.\\n\\nTake the coffee for example. It used to be $4. I think you can conservatively say KRC will sell at least 20 coffees an hour. So prior to the increase last month, they grossed $4x20 = $80/hr x 8 hrs= $640 day x 6 = $3840 x 4 = $15360 Gross a month in coffee.\\n\\nNow, to \"mitigate business costs\" KRC coffee went from $4 to $5...a 25% increase to one item. Using the same math as above:\\n$5 x 20 = $100/hr x 8hts = $800 day x 6 = $4800 x 4 = $19,200 Gross a month in coffee.\\n\\nThat\\'s an extra $4000 gross per month, just for coffees.\\n\\nTo put this in perspective, if you work a corporate job and are up for a promotion, you will get 3%, 5%, unheard of maybe 7%. In no way are you getting an instantaneous 25% increase to your salary.\\n\\nIf our gas went up 25% from the $4.69 it is, your gas would be $5.86. Could you conceive of waking up tomorrow and seeing gas for $5.86? There would be riots. When it goes up $0.10, it makes the news.\\n\\nIf Kings Road particularly cared about mitigating the cost of business but also being fair to its customers, that cost of a coffee would have went from $4 to $4.30. A blanket raise of 25% to the cost of a coffee, while selling hundreds of them a day, is simply taking advantage.\\n\\nThis review is meaningless, every seat outside will be taken every day with people happy to spend their money there. Good for them. But remember, these increases are not to mitigate business costs. It is a gratuitous raise in prices. Two eggs toast, bacon and potatoes for $19?.. more power to you.',\n",

Then, I ordered two Happy Meals, and they told me if I wanted a plastic bag big enough to carry them, that’s another $0.10. What kind of nickel-and-diming is this?\\n\\nTo make it worse, both Happy Meals had the exact same toy — Diamond Block & Steve. The packaging clearly shows what’s inside, so staff can pick and choose what to give out. The store was NOT busy when I came in (which makes sense now), so I know the staff saw who I was and what I ordered. Giving me the same toy twice feels like blatant disrespect — and I can’t help but feel like it was intentional because I’m an older Asian man. That’s discrimination, plain and simple.\\n\\nAnd let’s talk about customer service — nonexistent. When I asked a question about the bag charge at the counter, two employees walked right past me and ignored me. I literally had to raise my voice and say “Excuse me” just to get a response. That is completely rude and unprofessional.\\n\\nI usually have decent experiences at McDonald's, but this was just awful.

I was curious to try this place out because I am a healthcare worker that used to work down the street.  I was very hungry when I came here during my lunch break.  I bought a breakfast burrito that comes with a little side of salsa.  The burrito itself was $21.50!  I waited outside for my order for about 15 minutes.  When I came back and asked for an extra side of salsa, the staff was looking at me strangely like I did something wrong and they wanted to charge me $1.50 for a little side of salsa!!  I was incredibly disappointed by the service and overall quality of the food.  I must say the food prices does not match quality and taste.  I told myself to never come back here and I can make a better breakfast burrito than this place after this experience.\",\n",

We were greeted with attitude by the doorman, and then by a tall, expressionless host who didn’t even bother to fake politeness. He simply told us — with zero apology or explanation — that the table we reserved for dinner was not actually for dinner. The place was completely empty, yet he offered no solution, no alternative, just a dismissive look and a cold shoulder.\\n\\nThe building is literally crumbling, the energy is depressing, and the staff clearly couldn’t care less. Thankfully, we walked out and ended up having an amazing dinner elsewhere — with great food, warm service, and zero pretension.\\n\\nBottom line: I’ve traveled the world and dined at top-rated and hidden gem restaurants alike, but I’ve never been treated with such arrogance and neglect. If you have any other option nearby — even a street cart — go there instead. This place is nothing more than a rotting, self-important dump living off past glory.',\n",

       "         'text': 'I’ve been visiting Chateau for many years now. I’ve stayed at the hotel and dined here many times. I had the worst experience today. I made a reservation online for lunch today for a party of three. First, the hostess that came over to great is after we were seated was completely arrogant and uppity. After asking her to sit us in the garden rather then in the area she sat us, she seemed annoyed and upset. She informed us she had to get person from the hotel maître D’ which was fine.  The Maître D’ came over to our table and asked us if there was a problem in a very authoritative tone. I explained that I would like to be seated in the garden as that’s where I usually would sit when I visited the restaurant in the past. She then told me no because for the reason that that area was only for hotel guests which was untrue because I had sat in that area many times before even if I didn’t stay at the hotel. The hostess then moved us over to a low seated sofa that was near the front that was way too low to eat a meal at so I suggested sitting at a table across that area. So she sat us there with of course a long face and a very rude disposition. After ordering our drinks from our waiter Alex, the area where we sat was very hot due to not having shade or an umbrella over the little area. Alex cam by and I merely asked if he wouldn’t mind moving the umbrella that was adjacent to me over us so we could have some shade as we really liked this table but just needed shade. He then told me we will move you guys over to that area after I ask the maitre D’ — I never asked Alex to move us. I asked if he could move a umbrella over to where we were. So, here we go, moving for the third time. At this point, I felt like all of the hotel staff was annoyed at us because after that Alex was horrible. His service was minimal and he didn’t acknowledge any small talk. He barely came over to ask if we needed water or anything. The hostess had whispered something in his ear as my daughter noticed and it was awful after that! Not only was I disgusted at this service for Chateau. I felt invisible and unseen and it didn’t feel good. I’ve been a customer for many years here but frankly after today I will never go back! Very disappointing. I’m from the Santa Barbara area and live here in LA and in Scottsdale.\\n\\n— anonymously saddened by this',\n",

       "         'text': 'I sent this to the chateau a couple weeks ago and never heard back, so here you go…\\n\\nGood morning Casey. I spent the weekend at the chateau with family in a two bedroom suite and wanted to give you some feedback on our experience.\\n\\nFirst, we love the hotel and have stayed here many times. It’s always been a special place and we were looking forward to another great stay. Unfortunately the service on this trip was a big disappointment.\\n\\nWe checked in at the desk at 2:15 Friday and were told the room wasn’t ready. The desk person said “the room had just been vacated” (never a good thing to say when check out is usually 11:00 or 12:00) and that it would be ready soon, around 3:00. We went to the pool and called the desk at 3:00 and they said closer to 4:00 and they would bring us the key at the pool area. I never heard back so I called at 4:00 and was informed that the room was ready (would have been nice to know) and would we like to have the key delivered to the pool area.  Ok fine. They also agreed to get our bags up to our room. We finally got the key and saw our bags on a cart on the ground level unattended so we just took them ourselves (anyone could have taken them). I was left with the impression that staff was just not communicating with one another or with us through this episode.\\n\\nOn Thursday last week I received a very nice email welcoming us and asking if we needed help with dinner reservations or anything else. I asked for a 6:30 dinner reservation on Saturday and three in-room pedicures at 9:00 am on Saturday. The response was quick and I was told that everything was taken care of. Wonderful! I followed up right away with an email asking to change the pedicures to 10:00 am but never heard back. When I called after we checked in to ask about the time change for the pedicure the staff person said “oh yes, I changed the time but didn’t get back to you.” Um, ok, I guess.\\n\\nOn Friday evening as we were leaving for dinner I called the front desk to ask for more coffee pods and some milk for coffee. When we got back from dinner we had the coffee pods and milk but our door had been left unlocked.\\n\\nOn Saturday morning at 10:00 am I called the front desk to ask if the nail technicians were on their way up and was told they should be here any minute. At 10:30 they still had not shown up and nobody had called so I went down to the front desk to cancel the pedicures. The people at the desk seemed confused.\\n\\nOn Saturday afternoon I went to the restaurant hostess and asked if we could change our dinner reservation from 6:30 to 7:30 only to find that we did not have a reservation. They said that they would find a way to fit us in at 7:15.\\n\\nAny one or two issues would not have been a problem but it seemed to be one thing after another and it added up to an overall negative experience. Not what one would expect for a $2,000 per night hotel room. I wanted to send this directly rather than posting it to a review website hoping you would appreciate knowing.\\n\\nThanks.',\n",

We were greeted by an older waitress who was professional and efficient—her service was smooth and without issue.\\n\\nHowever, we couldn’t help but notice how much has changed since the pandemic. One of the most surprising things was the downgrade in the staff uniforms. They used to wear distinctive, elegant attire, but now the uniforms appear very plain and unappealing.\\n\\nAs usual, we ordered the Lawry’s Prime Rib dinner (Lawry Cut) and requested our usual sides: the half & half (cream corn and spinach) and baked potato with all the toppings. Unfortunately, our waitress informed us that both the half & half and baked potato options are no longer offered. So, I opted for the cream corn and my husband chose the spinach so we could share. The mashed potatoes, which replaced the baked potato, were disappointing, and the prime rib itself didn’t taste the same—we couldn’t tell if it was the meat quality or the seasoning that had changed. The spinach also had an odd flavor.\\n\\nThankfully, the spinning salad, cream corn, and Yorkshire still tasted as good as we remembered. Since it was our anniversary, we expected the usual complimentary champagne and dessert, but this time we only received champagne. While the champagne wasn’t charged, we were surprised to see a charge for dessert, indicating Lawry’s may have stopped offering complimentary sweets for special occasions.\\n\\nSadly, this location is no longer what it used to be. We don’t plan to return for future celebrations. A few weeks later, my parents celebrated their anniversary and, after hearing about our experience, decided to go to the Las Vegas Lawry’s instead. They had a much better experience—with excellent service, the classic side options still available, and complimentary champagne and dessert included.',\n",

       "         'text': 'Lawry’s The Prime Rib – Los Angeles\\nThis isn’t just dinner. It’s a legendary LA experience.\\n\\nIf you’re in LA and want a meal that feels like something special, Lawry’s The Prime Rib is IT. From the moment we sat down to the last bite of dessert, everything was smooth, classy, and full of flavor.\\n\\nWe went with the LA Tasting Experience, which came with prime rib, two sides, a lobster tail, dessert, and a starter salad — and let me tell you, it was a full-on performance.\\n\\nLet’s start with the salad. Sounds basic, right? Nah — they made it an event. They rolled out a massive stainless steel bowl on ice and spun it tableside while dressing it like some gourmet DJ. Fresh greens, chilled to perfection, and that signature Lawry’s vinaigrette hit hard — light, tangy, refreshing. It wasn’t just salad; it was a statement.\\n\\nThen came the main attraction:\\nThe prime rib. Carved right next to the table by a guy who seriously made the moment. I’ve got a video of him slicing it up with surgical precision and hyping the plate like it was his own mixtape. Super friendly, smooth with the knife, and just added this whole layer of entertainment and class to the meal. That energy made the whole experience feel five-star before I even took a bite.\\n\\nAnd the prime rib itself? Pure fire. Perfectly cooked, rich, juicy, melt-in-your-mouth. The lobster tail was solid — maybe just slightly under, but still buttery and flavorful. The creamed corn? Elite. Comforting, sweet, creamy — easily one of the top sides. Mashed potatoes were solid, not mind-blowing, but a good base to soak up all that jus. Everything hit the spot.\\n\\nThe dessert at the end was straight-up decadent. Sweet, rich, and beautifully presented — a proper grand finale to the whole show.\\n\\nDidn’t get a drink this time, but I regret that now — the cocktail list looked classy, and I’m definitely grabbing one next round.\\n\\nFinal thoughts: Lawry’s is not just a place to eat — it’s a place to celebrate. Whether it’s your first time or your fifteenth, they make you feel like a VIP. Between the spinning salad, the tableside carving, the high-quality food, and the top-tier service, it’s a full-on experience that’s worth every dollar.\\n\\nHighly recommend for birthdays, date nights, or if you just want to treat yourself to something unforgettable.\\nLawry’s is a true LA classic — and they still got it.',\n",

To our surprised they were filming on the day we went. We absolutely had an amazing time here. The ambience was perfect. So many interesting things to look at. It was so pretty. The service was fantastic and superb. Everyone was very very generous and kind here. We ordered the burger and the garlic fries. The burger has brie and a good amount of it as well. It was delightful. As for the garlic fries they were cooked to perfection, the crispy ness and the garlic. Created this nostalgic moment on our taste buds. Def recommend anyone who's in the area to come on in. The owner was here as well. While they were in between filming we had a glimpse of her beauty. She was walking around greeting all her guest. Honestly I would def come back here in the future especially if I'm in the area. If you are deciding to eat and enjoy your time here def recommend. The other guest across from us kept suggesting that we get the drinks here because they are wonderful. My friend honey and I wanted to say thank you for the hospitality and the time we had.\",\n",

The line is always out the door continuously. We finally got a decent coffee after being in Universal City for the theme park. We ordered so much food. $120 worth of food for the both of us.\\n\\nAmazon Rainforest Smoothie- mostly tastes like acai and bananas, like a smoothie I make at home.\\n\\nPistachio latte- the perfect sweetness and the perfect amount of pistachio flavor. SOOO deliciously made.\\n\\nLatte- delicious\\n\\nItalian cappuccino- less foam with more milk. Delicious.\\n\\nYes we each had 2 drinks. LOL!\\n\\nThey ran out of pistachio chocolate croissant and the Nutella girella bun. So I ordered a chocolate croissant- the most disappointing item today. It wasn’t buttery, airy, fluffy or chewy. It was stale and blah. $5 gone.\\n\\nKing French Toast- not worth it. It was a big brick of bread with lots of strawberries and blueberries around it. The French toast is a wet style type of French toast. It came with a little syrup cup. It was a simple French toast, nothing special that I could get anywhere. It just had a nice presentation.\\n\\nBreakfast sausage side 2pcs- they were sooooooo juicy and flavorful. The breakfast sausages are worth it.\\n\\nPoached salmon- so delicious. The multi grain bread tasted better than it looked. Eggs were poached perfectly and the salmon was nice and salty.\\n\\nSalmon plate with onion bagel- the onion bagel was so much better than my chocolate croissant! The salmon and capers were perfect together. Cream cheese was whipped and fluffy. Roman tomatoes were very sweet. I loved eating half of my dish wrapped in the Romain lettuce and the other half in my onion bagel. So refreshing.\\n\\nI would definitely come back again and try more items.\\n\\nParking sucks!

Upon arrival at the restaurant, one is immediately struck by the beauty of the hotel, with its elegant chandeliers and inviting atmosphere. The valet service, while attentive, may come across as overly eager to park cars in prime spots, which may not always be necessary. Upon leaving, I handed $100 bill with my ticket and the polite gentleman thanked me and walked away. I did not ask for my car to be taken care of or parked in front. I wanted my change but none was given. So much for a Porsche!\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is tastefully decorated but may be considered plain by some. The food, however, is exceptional, though the prices may not be suitable for everyone. A basic dinner for two resulted in a bill totaling $1000, which may be considered steep compared to other high-end establishments such as BOA Steakhouse or Mastros, where a similar meal may cost $400-$500, including luxurious items like black caviar. For 2 People!\\n\\nDespite the high prices, the quality of the food and the exceptional service provided by the servers were highlights of the dining experience. However, the cost of items such as a $50-$75 old fashioned cocktail may be seen as excessive when compared to other establishments. It tasted just as bad as Crown Apply Royal on ice which is usually $12-$15 dollars!\\n\\nWhile the food was enjoyable, the overall experience may not justify the steep prices, leading to a decision not to return in the future.',\n",

       "         'text': 'Shrimp cocktail 10/10. They were perfectly plump, fresh, and appropriately priced. The horseradish and cocktail sauce are exquisite. The lobster was also fantastic. Perfectly prepared, pricey, but given the location, fairly priced. The sides were underwhelming. The mac n cheese was oily, separated, and flavorless. The garlic mashed potatoes were very average as well. You get large portions on the sides, but the quality just isn’t there for a restaurant of this caliber. I did enjoy the mojito. It was fresh and strong. The key lime pie was delectable but their “famous” butter cake was very average. I also don’t understand why they serve a heaping bowl of whipped cream with their desserts. The waitstaff was attentive and knowledgeable. No complaints there. The atmosphere is Beverly Hills people that are upper echelon or surely think they are upper echelon. Depending on your opinion of such people, you may either enjoy or detest such company. All that said, I would return for the shrimp cocktail and a mojito.',\n",

I thought it was cooked perfectly and was delicious. The Garlic Mashed Potatoes were also very good (and a huge portion that can be shared between 3 or 4 people).\\n\\nOur waiter and the staff was very courteous. We ordered dessert after their closing time, and they didn't rush us at all even though we felt bad for staying late. Speaking of dessert, the Warm Butter Cake was really good.\\n\\nThe restaurant was expensive, but that was anticipated since it's a nice steakhouse located right in Beverly Hills. A lot of people were celebrating their birthdays there and it looked like the perfect restaurant for a celebration.\",\n",

The restaurant looked nice,and the fresh bread was great at first, however living music was boring sorry to say that . But then I noticed a hair in the butter, which completely ruined our appetite. We told the waitress, and the manager came over to apologize — he was kind and offered to take care of it.\\n\\nWe were about to leave, but since the food had just arrived and my friend was hungry, we decided to stay as the manager showed really want us to stay for it , so we felt bad to leave . The steak was good, but the sea bass and branzino fish were disappointing. After the hair incident, it was hard to enjoy anything. When checked out The manager gave us $90 off, we paid about $180 with tips , but honestly, that didn’t feel like enough for a place in Beverly Hills with a cleanliness issue, for my experience they should have offered way better, but we didn’t want to fight for it , we had a rush dinner and left unhappily. Waitress was nice, but the customer service wasn’t great, very bad experience , no reason to go back !',\n",

       "         'text': \"Last night, my husband and I, joined by two of his rock 'n' roll-loving friends, decided to hit up the infamous Rainbow Bar & Grill before catching a show for Rose Tattoo. Little did I know I was stepping into a legendary hub of rock history, where the food is served with a side of celebrity sighting and a sprinkle of confusion!\\n\\nWe kicked things off with a Caesar salad that was just... well, let’s say it was more “Caesar salad” than “Wow, I’m alive!” It was like a salad that had dreams of grandeur but forgot its ambition at home. Then came the lasagna, which could’ve used a little more pizzazz. Think of it as that quiet kid in class who turns out to be a genius but never raises their hand.\\n\\nNow, let’s talk about the star of the show: the Rainbow Pizza! It was decent, definitely not the most mind-blowing pizza I’ve ever had, but hey, it’s not easy being a pizza in a restaurant known for hosting rock legends. I mean, how can you compete with all that musical talent?\\n\\nAs I munched away, I couldn’t help but notice fans swooping in like bees to honey, thanking the rock stars at the next table. Meanwhile, I was blissfully unaware of who they were, feeling a bit like the kid who shows up to a costume party in regular clothes. “Thanks for what?” I thought, while trying to decipher the rock ‘n’ roll lingo flying over my head.\\n\\nIn the end, we left with full bellies and a newfound appreciation for the legends that walk among us—though I’m still not sure who they were! So, if you’re looking for a pre-show meal that’s just as colorful as the name suggests, Rainbow Bar & Grill is your spot. Just remember to brush up on your rock star trivia before you go, unless you want to blend in like I did!\\n\\nOverall, a fun experience with a side of confusion and a dash of lasagna! Would I go back? Absolutely! Next time, I’ll just order a side of rock history with my meal.\",\n",

From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by a clean, well-organized space with an incredible variety of items—everything from clothing to household goods - all at great prices.\\n\\nWhat stood out most to me was the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. They made my shopping experience enjoyable and easy, offering assistance when needed. I was also thrilled to know that my purchases and donations directly benefit local communities by supporting Goodwill's mission of providing job training, employment placement, and other vital services.\\n\\nIt's wonderful to support such a meaningful cause while finding great deals. I’ll definitely be back soon and recommend this location to anyone looking for affordable items or wanting to give back to the community. Keep up the amazing work!\",\n",

It was frustrating but I’m not sure if it was truly anyone’s fault - at least not the store itself. We came here after calling to ask if the book we were buying as a birthday gift was in stock (it was!!) but as we walked into the store the employee there said he was about to close for a break but the store would reopen in 20 minutes. We were a bit annoyed because we just wanted to take the book and pay (it would have taken 2 minutes) but we get it - they need to take their breaks! We figured that’s a short enough time that we could wait and enjoy the free outdoor concert going on outside. 20 minutes go by (rather slow to be honest - concert was not that great lol) and the store is not open. Okay. That can happen. But the door sign says they will be back in 30. Okay so he got it wrong. That’s fine. 30 minutes go by and still not open. 45 minutes go by and someone finally shows up. A different employee I might add!! So they did a shift change with a 45 minute break (the second employee was late I assume?) and the second employee was carrying a bunch of books. The purchase took less than 2 minutes and we were pretty annoyed that we were waiting over 45 minutes for that. It’s a small store so the employee must have known it wouldn’t take long. But—all in all we kind of want to blame ourselves because we should have explained that to the employee and not been so polite. But the late employee and weird shift change set up should be fixed. Had we not urgently needed the book we would have ordered online and that’s what we will do in the future! So not too bad but not great either. Th',\n",

RJ, the founder, has put his heart and soul into this vision for over two decades, and it shows in the store’s global reach and local presence.\\n\\nAre there areas for growth? Of course. Every small business has growing pains — especially one run largely by a single individual trying to balance online operations, in-store customer service, and inventory in a niche space. But that doesn’t erase the impact this store has had on thousands of lives, including my own. To be able to walk in and buy a meaningful gift for someone’s sobriety birthday — and to feel connected to a larger community of recovery — is something truly rare.\\n\\nWe need more places like this, not fewer. And we need to remember that the people behind them are human, too. I’m grateful this store exists and proud to support it.',\n",

Parking is expensive whether you  valet or park yourself, you're paying $52 to park less than 20 feet from the front door of the building. The room we booked had a dirty mattress with dark orange stains on its sides. They just covered them with sheets so that you wouldn't see them. Very unsanitary for what we paid for the room. When it came time to sleep there was a constant noise coming from somewhere on the first floor that kept us up. I walked out to the front desk to find out that other customers had already called and complained about the same noise we had been hearing all night. The front desk attendant told the customer that they weren't able to do anything about it and that they weren't able to change their room either. Other than what we experienced here it's a decent hotel but will eventually fork over the cash and book a nicer more accommodating hotel.\",\n",

What truly set the hotel apart was the outstanding support from Steven during the booking process. I began emailing him months in advance to plan for my team's stay, and despite numerous updates and changes leading up to our event, Steven consistently provided prompt and helpful assistance. He was genuinely committed to ensuring my team had a memorable experience. His dedication extended beyond the booking itself – he even emailed my team upon arrival to personally welcome them and offer his assistance, a warm touch that my team greatly appreciated. The rooms were very nice and cozy, and everyone was extremely pleased with their stay. Beyond the service, the hotel excels in other areas. Our team enjoyed a fantastic meal at SALT, the hotel restaurant, which boasts a diverse menu and a beautiful waterfront view. My team spent their last evening relaxing by the pool, enjoying food and drinks in a pleasant atmosphere; it was a wonderful way for them to unwind and recharge before traveling home the following day. The hotel's prime location in the heart of Marina Del Rey is also a major plus, offering easy access to explore the area's many activities and dining options. Thank you Steven for being such a joy to work with and creating such a wonderful experience for my team. I look forward to many future bookings at this hotel!\",\n",

Dishes named things like I Am Radiant or I Am Love!  The food was amazing, but it was the intention behind it that got me. It felt like someone cooked with love and set the table for your soul.',\n",

       "         'text': 'It has been many years since I have come to this location in Venice, and I was so pleased. My last visit was in 2019, before the pandemic. It was delicious then. it is divine now. Last night, I met up with a friend for her birthday event, and was not disappointed. I have always loved the food and service, and was so pleasantly surprised when I walked in the door. We had made a reservation for 10 people, and they seated us in the back, we had plenty of room! In the six years since my last visit, the location has transformed dramatically, the inside looks beautiful and refreshed, and the food options have expanded. I love vegan food. The group of girls I was with are all carnivores, but we all adore café gratitude, and our girlfriend wanted to spend her birthday here. Everything is delicious. I ordered an “i am mystical” adaptogenic mayan hot chocolate with almond milk, and for my main, a bowl with black beans, vegan cheese, potato, kale, tomatoes, onions, carrots, zucchini, allllll the veggies. The table had ordered several starters, including the loaded nachos, fried cauliflower, and something that I think was meant to resemble calamari, but may have actually been jackfruit. Delicious, delicious, delicious, all of it and the portions were so massive, I took half of my entrée home. Another person ordered a pizza, and it looked freaking delicious. As a South Asian American woman, vegan food is not unusual for me. Café gratitude takes such great care with their flavors, spices, ingredients, and I love that the menu has sections with specific details about allergies. Service was amazing as well, our server was a lovely young man (aussie or kiwi with long blonde hair?) who was kind enough to take our group photo at the end of the evening. The angelic server brought over some strawberry ice cream with a candle for our birthday girl. Do yourself a favor and come to this restaurant, I promise you won’t be disappointed. I love it so much, and I wish I didn’t live so far away. I don’t bother with street parking in that area, it’s impossible to find. I like the underground lot. They do validate and take some $ off the parking, if you park in the underground lot.',\n",

       "         'text': 'Bodega is my favorite place in Santa Monica so far!!!\\n\\nI’ve been here multiple times during the day, and every time it’s been a great experience. I usually get coffee along with some food, and everything I’ve tried has been really good. I’ve had a few of their pizzas, each one was delicious. Crusty and flavorful. I also really love the chicken wrap, probably it is the best I’ve tried so far. Last time I tried sandwich and it was also great. The portion sizes here are generous, and the prices are very reasonable, especially for that area. The food always comes out pretty quickly and tastes fresh. The coffee and tea are also good.\\n\\nThe interior is really nice. There are plenty of tables and different seating options. My favorite spot is the cozy sofas in the corner, it’s the perfect place to relax or to work. Overall, it’s a great place to meet up with friends, have a casual meal, or even get some work done. They also have outdoor tables, which are perfect for enjoying food on a nice day.\\n\\nThe staff is amazing, always friendly, respectful, and welcoming.\\n\\nI haven’t been here in the evening yet, when the cafe transforms into a wine bar, but I’m really looking forward to checking that out. Honestly, I don’t have anything bad to say about this place. It’s a great spot, and I’ll definitely keep coming back.',\n",

Lots of plants, lots of natural light, and two large rooms upstairs for workspace, which was almost empty on a Saturday morning at 9am. The guy who took my order was very nice and food was ready in under 10 min.',\n",

At the front entrance, there's a nice selection of ready-to-go meals (soups, salads, sandwiches, wraps, and other small sides) and a ton of artisan baked goods and desserts. They are popluar for their coffees and yes my hot vanilla latte was exceptional. They also sell groceries which is pretty cool. My pretzel croissant sandwich with a medium fried egg and a side of tater tots was so delicious. The croissant was fresh and flaky. Parking is either metered street parking or free parking in the surrounding residential streets (watch for street cleaning days). Their ready-to-go Turkey Reuben Sandwich and Cool Sesame Noodles with Chicken were also very tasty. Can't wait to go back.\",\n",

Is lame how they cheat members, specially when they order to go, staff decided how they going to handle your order , whether you like it or not ,your drink will not came up it should .\\nThe two cups on the photo is how much is ‘light ice’ for them ,the other one is how much amount the ice will grow inside of the cup and make your drink have less lemonade or whatever style you ordered, either way ,will be les amount of what you paid .\\nSadly ,this is been a situation for 3 months, how much money I had lost ??? probably like 150 .',\n",

       "         'text': 'We stayed at an Airbnb nearby and decided to try Blue Daisy for breakfast with my wife and our 11-month-old baby on a Monday morning around 8 am. When we arrived, it was almost empty, but by 9 am, the place was completely full, which shows how popular it is!\\n\\nThe restaurant has a large and beautiful outdoor patio, which is perfect for enjoying the sunny Santa Monica weather. There’s also plenty of indoor seating if you prefer to dine inside. One of the highlights for us was that they had a high chair available, making it very family-friendly and convenient for parents.\\n\\n[HOT DRINKS]\\n\\n+Turkish Coffee (small, espresso size) for $5 - 4/5\\n+Turkish Latté (creamy and a touch of sweetness) for $6.50 - I didn’t try it, but my wife enjoyed it.\\n\\n[BREAKFAST]\\n\\n+Breakfast Combo (3 eggs any style, turkey bacon, French toast with fruit) for $20 - Everything was great, but I wished I ordered normal bacon instead of the turkey bacon. The turkey bacon was a bit dry and not as enjoyable as normal bacon would have been. - 4.5/5\\n+Breakfast Burrito (eggs, bacon, meatsauce, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, mix cheese, side of salsa, and mix green salad) for $20 - I didn’t try it, but my wife liked it a lot.\\n\\n[SIDES]\\n\\n+Seasoned French fries for $7 - 4.5/5\\n\\nOverall, the food was delicious, and the atmosphere was welcoming and comfortable. It’s a great spot for breakfast or brunch, whether you’re with family, friends, or even solo. I’d definitely recommend it, and we’d love to come back again on our next visit to Santa Monica!',\n",

Top-notch, as always—exactly what you’d expect from the world’s most ubiquitous coffee chain. Just a heartfelt thanks to Starbucks for making this birthday unforgettable.',\n",

The bathroom tiles were a work of art, the beds were super comfortable with big pillows, and the room temperature was just right.\\n\\nWe had a ball! It's conveniently close to Beverly Hills and Rodeo Drive, making it easy to explore the best shopping spots.

       "         'text': 'We stayed in January 2025 in two Deluxe Ocean view rooms.  Rooms were clean and adequately furnished. Rooms had usable mini fridges.  We had a room on each side of the building so views were either overlooking the driveway and facing the Santa Monica pier in the Venice direction (south east) or overlooking the pool area and towards the Palisades Park and beach (north west) (both with ocean views just opposite directions). Other reviews did complain about the nightclub music. Our room facing north (opposite side from the nightclub the music was not noticeable, the south facing room yes the music was noticeable however if the balcony door was closed it was ok.  The older building seems like it would be far enough away not to hear it. Really great gym with good equipment and free weights.  Really nice pool and the temperature was just perfect (weather was a bit gloomy most the days we were there and we still went in the pool comfortably every day). Nice hot tub in pool area also. The majestic tree out front of the lobby and the entrance gives a really nice vibe.  The Dogtown coffee was a good regular start to the day.  The location is nice just a little up and away from crowded pier area but still walking distance to 3rd Street Promenade shopping and plenty of food options around. Also easy walk to the Pier. There is also a hotel car which can take you to local places at no charge.  Valet parking was efficient also. Great friendly staff, really enjoyed this hotel and will return when next in LA.',\n",

We love their simple BRATWURST, which is fine cuts of pork, coriander with some nutmeg. Their BOCKWURST is yummy veal and pork. Also try some of their hard to find elsewhere ones, like RATTLESNAKE & RABBIT with JALAPEÑO PEPPERS. It is very buttery and a tad spicy.  The PHEASANT with HERBS DE PROVENCE is just great. Everything they have is wonderful.\\n\\nYou can have it delivered or do take away.\\n\\nWhat we really love is you can buy uncooked sausages there. We do that a lot.

The service went downhill from there! We had 3 different servers. I never received a single refill of water until the end of the meal. My son's Arnold Palmer was just lemonade on the 2nd refill because they dumped the tea and couldn't accommodate his refills of Arnold Palmer! My honey's coke zero had zero syrup on his refill, and the lady couldn't say why. We knew why. It was because they were rushing us out the door at that point, and didn't want to take the time to put on another bag of syrup! I took the time to set aside a salad and fries that we planned to take back to our hotel room since we were being rushed to leave, and before I knew it she cleared the fries. Then, she tried to swipe the salad which is when I told her I specifically set aside the fries and salad (uneaten ) to take home. Instead of bringing me a container to put my salad in, she rushed away with my salad which in my opinion would be a health code violation. Why would she parade my salad through the restaurant and what was it exposed to? This Cheesecake Factory definitely did not meet my expectations and is overpriced between the parking at $8.50 to the soda at $5.50, especially when they're going to get cheap on the refills at closing for something that really only costs the business $.25 cents per soda! He brought one basket of bread for 5 adults.  Another example of putting the business before the customer!\",\n",

More importantly, the restaurant needs to know that, too.  Pitfire gets the assignment: it knows what lane to be in, and it does so really well.\\n\\nBelieve it or not, I've never tried the pizza here.  I'm from NYC and lived there for too long to enjoy pizza from a spot like this.  So I don't even try, but that doesn't mean that Pitfire fails.  I've come here delicious salad and cheesy knots for years, with a soft serve ice cream to boot.\\n\\nThe salad is a perfect Italian chopped. They get the ingredients and dressing right, and yes, you could f*** up a salad.  The cheesy knots are ridiculous - cheesy, crunchy on the outside yet soft on the inside, and with a savory marinara sauce to dip.\\n\\nThe soft serve isn't the best quality ice cream for sure, but it does the trick.  Who doesn't like a good swirl? 🍦\\n\\nI'll also mention that the staff always goes out of their way to be nice and cater to your every need...despite it being fast casual. There's also a ton of space - both indoor and outdoor.\\n\\nThis combo is so good that I've probably had it at least 15 times...and don't even live in LA anymore.  Is there better quality food to be had in the city? Of course.  But if you want a casual salad/pizza/breadsticks spot with super nice staff, lots of space and tasty food, Pitfire should be one of your go-to's.\",\n",

Parking is expensive whether you  valet or park yourself, you're paying $52 to park less than 20 feet from the front door of the building. The room we booked had a dirty mattress with dark orange stains on its sides. They just covered them with sheets so that you wouldn't see them. Very unsanitary for what we paid for the room. When it came time to sleep there was a constant noise coming from somewhere on the first floor that kept us up. I walked out to the front desk to find out that other customers had already called and complained about the same noise we had been hearing all night. The front desk attendant told the customer that they weren't able to do anything about it and that they weren't able to change their room either. Other than what we experienced here it's a decent hotel but will eventually fork over the cash and book a nicer more accommodating hotel.\",\n",

The hotel is beautiful from top to bottom and I love the signature aroma they have crafted for the lobby. Salt cafe is wonderfully tasty and we loved how comfortable the bed was, and the tiled showers. On the last day unfortunately there was some problems with the water but it was due to the local county and not the hotel. Marlee was also super friendly and when we had questions about modifying our reservation she was able to upgrade us to a better room. Thank you so much!\",\n",

What truly set the hotel apart was the outstanding support from Steven during the booking process. I began emailing him months in advance to plan for my team's stay, and despite numerous updates and changes leading up to our event, Steven consistently provided prompt and helpful assistance. He was genuinely committed to ensuring my team had a memorable experience. His dedication extended beyond the booking itself – he even emailed my team upon arrival to personally welcome them and offer his assistance, a warm touch that my team greatly appreciated. The rooms were very nice and cozy, and everyone was extremely pleased with their stay. Beyond the service, the hotel excels in other areas. Our team enjoyed a fantastic meal at SALT, the hotel restaurant, which boasts a diverse menu and a beautiful waterfront view. My team spent their last evening relaxing by the pool, enjoying food and drinks in a pleasant atmosphere; it was a wonderful way for them to unwind and recharge before traveling home the following day. The hotel's prime location in the heart of Marina Del Rey is also a major plus, offering easy access to explore the area's many activities and dining options. Thank you Steven for being such a joy to work with and creating such a wonderful experience for my team. I look forward to many future bookings at this hotel!\",\n",

       "         'text': 'Originally founded in Long Beach in the late 1990s I have been coming to various Yard House locations since college and they are all consistently good. I would call it more of a sports bar than anything else because it’s a great place to watch a game and the amount of beer selection is almost unbeatable. I moved to LA six years ago, but I’m originally from San Diego and was very happy to see that many San Diego beers are on this beer list. It’s pretty large on the inside with many different types of seating options from high top, to booth, to sitting around the giant O shaped bar. There are TV screens everywhere with all different sorts of games and entertainment and the drinks and food were flowing fast. Parking is very easy here because there is free parking attached to the mall that is multiple stories. Also everything that we order always comes out really fast. I will say that sometimes the servers are not the most friendly, but that is more of a reflection on who you get when you visit versus each location.\\n\\nThe menu here is very large and filled with all sorts of great options. It is also very fair priced and the portion sizes are generous. I’m a big fan of their vampire tacos, a lot of their appetizers. I seem to get something new every time I come here. For my drink this visit I ordered the Honey Beer from Escondido, which is a part of Northern San Diego, and I honestly loved it. It’s very crisp and refreshing and had a great taste. For my meal I chose the Turkey Club and thought it was large and really good. I have zero complaints about it and just really enjoyed it. We ate and drank all of this as we sat at a high top and enjoyed the NBA finals. I would recommend and I will be back again in the future.',\n",

We ordered the lobster garlic noodles, chicken nachos, and my wife enjoyed the Malibu Peach cocktail.\\n\\nThe lobster garlic noodles were delicious, with generous portions of lobster claws that were perfectly cooked. The noodles had a rich, buttery flavor that complemented the lobster well, though they were a bit heavier on the butter than I prefer. Also, the noodles were more broken than I remember from previous visits—I’d love to see them served with longer, more intact noodles like before.\\n\\nThe chicken nachos were impressive both in taste and portion size. They came piled high with toppings and could easily feed three to four people as an appetizer. The combination of melted cheese, tender chicken, and fresh toppings made it a crowd-pleaser.\\n\\nThe Malibu Peach cocktail was refreshing and well-balanced, with a fruity sweetness that wasn’t overpowering. It paired nicely with our meal and added a fun, tropical touch to the evening.\\n\\nOverall, we enjoyed our meal and would definitely come back, whether it’s for a casual night out or a gathering with friends and family. Looking forward to our next visit!',\n",

By the time I finished my first, I was already feeling it, but it was so good I couldn’t stop at just one. I ended up having three total before heading out (don’t worry, I took a Waymo back to my room), and they were consistently delicious, well-balanced, and exactly what you want from a beachside bar margarita.\\n\\nService was also a highlight. My waitress, Veronica, was beyond sweet—seriously, the kind of service that makes you want to come back just for the experience. Attentive, friendly, and made sure everything was perfect.\\n\\nThe upstairs bar was packed and way rowdier than I was in the mood for. But the downstairs patio was absolutely perfect. Even though it was a chilly night, the outdoor heaters were placed just right, keeping things warm while still letting you soak in the fresh ocean air.

We specifically asked for non-spicy dishes, but they still came out spicy, which made it hard to enjoy the meal. The portions were very large—too much, even by American standards.\\n\\nService during the meal was fast and simple, but the experience at checkout was uncomfortable. Coming from Europe, we’re not used to the tipping culture and usually tip based on the service. Since it wasn’t particularly good or attentive, we chose not to tip. The person who seemed to be the manager reprinted the check with the tip line left open and placed it back in front of us without a word. It felt passive-aggressive and awkward.\\n\\nOverall, not a place we’d return to. The food was okay, but the service and atmosphere left a bad taste.',\n",

Plus even the rice puffs they put on the table are gluten-free! AND, the food was super affordable for the quality and portion size.

       "         'text': \"We recently celebrated a 10th birthday party for my son's friend at Lucky Strike bowling alley, and it was an absolutely fabulous experience! From the get-go, the staff were welcoming and ensured our large group was accommodated without any hitches.\\n\\nWith ample alleys available, the kids had a great time rolling strikes and spares, with no waiting around for a free lane – a real plus when you have a group of excited ten-year-olds!\\n\\nWhat truly set Lucky Strike apart was their fast service. The staff were attentive, making sure our needs were met rapidly, from shoe rentals to food and drink orders, helping the party to move smoothly and keeping the kids happy.\\n\\nBut the fun didn't stop at bowling. After the kids had their fill of strikes and spares, Lucky Strike had another treat up its sleeve – video game sessions! This was a perfect wind-down activity after the high energy of bowling, and the variety of games available meant that every kid found something that they enjoyed.\\n\\nIt's not often you find a place that ticks all the boxes for a successful birthday event – ample space, rapid service, and a variety of entertainment options. Lucky Strike did all this and more, making for a memorable day out that the kids are still talking about. Whether you're planning a birthday party, a family outing, or just a day of fun, Lucky Strike is a strike out of the park. Highly recommend!\",\n",

I'm very impressed with the cleanliness and the service. We went on a Friday when they first opened at 12pm (Christmas week) and it was busy but not overly crowded. The kids had fun with their bumpers and are asking when they can come back. We didn't utilize their bar but it looked nice. In addition, they have a small arcade area that requires a prepaid card. The games were newer; a lot of prize type games. I wouldn't spend too much time here since each game is expensive and the prize payout is pretty hard. Still a nice addition to the bowling alley and got some usage from us.\",\n",

I bought a summer pass which is an unbelievable deal, you get to bowl and your shoes are complementary. You also get a discount off things like food or drinks. I look forward to coming on days when I know that they have a right staff that makes operations not only more efficient, but also gives customers an amazing experience.\",\n",

She had vitamins and teas for us and literally served us each drink to ensure we all could feel like a goddess this weekend. Her yoga classes and meditations were refreshing and energizing for the body and soul. We all left the retreat gaining new insights. It felt like a wonderful sisterhood of women who were there to support each other during this beautiful retreat weekend. Alanna is a warm and beautiful soul, deeply caring for the wellbeing of her clients. I think that every woman should get a chance to have have this beautiful experience at least once in her life. Thank you, Alanna for pouring your heart and soul into helping others learning to live a healthy lifestyle 💕\",\n",

I didn’t know what to expect with only juice and soup and herbs for the three days, but I never felt hungry or had any cravings. As a total beginner with yoga, I have to admit, it kicked my buttocks. However, my jeans were a little looser when I went home. As for meditation, I have some difficulty with that… SQUIRREL! It’s a little difficult for me to stay focused. Now that I’m back home, I started to check social media, saw a nasty comment from someone, was going to send a nasty response, when I decided to just let it go, which is what Alanna taught us to do. I am grateful for the weekend. Thank you very much, Alanna, it was the detox retreat that I truly needed.',\n",

Legos, Legos, and Legos!!! Barnes & Noble have Lego Exclusives :)\\n\\n4. Greeting cards, bookmarks, and journals are also sold here.\\n\\n5. Free parking lot with plenty of parking.\\n\\n6. Shopping center boasts others stores and eateries all within walkkng distance.\\n\\n7. Clean, organized, and easy to find your genre of choice.\\n\\nCons\\nI wish we had more book stores. Personal bias here. No cons about this location. Barnes & Noble has been around since 1873, first started out Charles Barnes home. First store opened in 1917 in New York by his son. The Barnes Family is doing something right. C\\'mon, grab a book.',\n",
